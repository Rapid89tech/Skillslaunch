YouTube: Summary of Microphone Polar Patterns  
Pickup patterns determine how a mic captures sound from different directions. Choosing the correct pattern can improve audio quality, reduce noise, and enhance focus on the intended source. Understanding these patterns is essential for mic placement, studio setup, and live sound engineering.

## **🎤 Lecture Notes: Mic Placement Techniques**

### **1\. Introduction to Mic Placement**

**Definition**: Mic placement refers to the positioning and orientation of a microphone relative to a sound source to achieve the desired tonal quality, clarity, and isolation.  
**Importance**: Affects tone, presence, noise level, and recording balance. Helps manage proximity effect, feedback, and room acoustics. Crucial in studio, live, and broadcast environments.

### **2\. Key Factors Affecting Mic Placement**

| Factor | Impact |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Distance** | Affects loudness, proximity effect, room tone |
| **Angle (off-axis/on-axis)** | Changes tonal character and clarity |
| **Environment** | Room acoustics can add echo or reverb |
| **Mic type/pattern** | Directionality determines optimal position |
| **Sound source type** | Different instruments or voices need different setups |

### **3\. General Guidelines for Mic Placement**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/z7bglcSQOC4](https://youtu.be/z7bglcSQOC4) 

* **On-Axis Placement**: Mic is pointed directly at the sound source. Brighter, clearer sound. Most sensitive to detail.  
* **Off-Axis Placement**: Mic is angled slightly away from the source. Reduces harshness, captures more room sound. Helps control plosives and sibilance.  
* **Close Miking**: 1–12 inches from source. Dry, detailed sound with low room reflection. Risks: proximity effect (bass boost), plosives.  
* **Distant Miking**: 1 foot or more from source. Natural, ambient sound. Best in acoustically treated or well-behaved rooms.

  ### **4\. Mic Placement for Voice (Podcasting, Vocals)**

| Technique | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Close Mic (6–12 inches)** | Clean, full voice; watch for plosives and sibilance |
| **Use of Pop Filter** | Prevents popping from "p" and "b" sounds |
| **Slight Off-Axis (15–30°)** | Reduces harshness and sibilance |
| **Distance Miking (1–2 feet)** | More natural voice, more room sound |
| **Tip**: Use cardioid or dynamic mics for vocal isolation in untreated rooms. |  |

  ### **5\. Mic Placement for Instruments**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/4G-XRxrqdbo](https://youtu.be/4G-XRxrqdbo) 

* **Acoustic Guitar**: 6–12 inches from the 12th fret, slightly off-axis. Avoid pointing directly at the sound hole (boomy). Combine mic on body \+ mic on neck for depth.  
* **Drums**:  
  * Kick drum: Inside shell (attack), outside front head (body)  
  * Snare: Top close mic, angled toward center  
  * Overheads: Spaced pair or XY over kit  
  * Room mics: Add ambience and depth  
* **Piano**:  
  * Upright: Behind soundboard or over open lid  
  * Grand: Multiple mics over soundboard strings  
  * Blend close and room mics for full tone  
* **Brass/Woodwinds**: Mic 6–12 inches from bell, slightly off-axis. Avoid placing directly in airflow.

  ### **6\. Stereo Mic Techniques**

| Technique | Description | Pattern | Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **XY** | Two cardioids at 90°, capsules close | Coincident | Tight stereo image, phase-coherent |
| **AB** | Two omnis spaced apart | Time difference | Wide stereo, natural room |
| **ORTF** | Two cardioids at 110°, 17cm apart | Near-coincident | Balanced stereo with space |
| **Mid/Side (M/S)** | One cardioid \+ one figure-8 mic | Adjustable width | Flexible post-processing |

  ### **7\. Mic Placement for Podcasting/Voiceovers**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/TDFrK6x1r7E](https://youtu.be/TDFrK6x1r7E) 

* **Home/Studio Recording**:  
  * Dynamic mic (e.g., SM7B) close to mouth (\~6 inches)  
  * Pop filter \+ boom arm for stability  
  * Cardioid pattern to minimize room noise  
* **Multiple Hosts/Guests**:  
  * Individual mics for each speaker  
  * Avoid mic bleed: position off-axis and use directional mics

  ### **8\. Common Mic Placement Mistakes**

| Mistake | Consequence |
| ----- | ----- |
| Mic too close to mouth | Plosives, boomy sound (proximity effect) |
| Mic too far from source | Room noise, lack of clarity |
| Directly in airflow path | Popping sounds from breath |
| Poor angle (on-axis sibilance) | Harsh "s" sounds, excessive treble |
| Incorrect mic type | Misbalanced tone or high noise floor |

  ### **9\. Practical Tips**

* Use headphones to monitor mic placement in real time  
* Record short tests at different angles/distances  
* Treat your room (even lightly) for better results  
* Use shock mounts and isolation to reduce handling noise  
* Label and document successful placements for future setups

  ### **10\. Summary**

YouTube: Summary of Mic Placement Techniques  
Mic placement is a critical skill in capturing professional audio. Depends on source, environment, mic type, and artistic intent. Small adjustments can result in significant tonal changes. Understanding placement techniques leads to cleaner, clearer, and more controlled recordings.

## **🎚️ Lecture Notes: Gain Staging**

### **1\. 🎧 What Is Gain Staging?**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/HH9Kcv7yEkc](https://youtu.be/HH9Kcv7yEkc) 

Gain staging is the process of managing the level (volume) of audio signals throughout the signal chain to avoid distortion, noise, or loss of clarity.  
**Goal**: Maintain optimal signal levels from recording to mixing to mastering — not too quiet (adds noise), not too loud (causes clipping).

### **2\. 🎙️ Why Is Gain Staging Important?**

* Prevents clipping (distortion from too-high levels)  
* Avoids noise floor (from boosting low-level signals)  
* Ensures headroom (space before distortion point)  
* Improves mix clarity (balanced levels feed processors better)  
* Protects speakers & ears (from accidental volume spikes)

### **3\. 📈 Signal Flow and Gain Stages**

A signal chain has multiple stages where gain can be adjusted:

| Stage | Example |
| ----- | ----- |
| Source | Microphone, instrument, sample |
| Preamp | Audio interface or mixer gain knobs |
| Input Level | DAW track input meters |
| Insert Effects | EQ, compression, etc. |
| Fader | Channel volume fader |
| Master Bus | Final output meter |
| Each of these points is a gain stage and must be managed. |  |

### **4\. 📊 Ideal Level Guidelines**

| Stage | Recommended Peak |
| ----- | ----- |
| Recording | \-18 dBFS to \-12 dBFS (digital meters) |
| DAW Track Input | \~-12 dBFS |
| After EQ/FX | Keep under \-6 dBFS |
| Master Output | Target \-6 dBFS before mastering |
| **Note**: In analog systems, engineers aim for 0 VU (analog meters), while in digital systems, the ceiling is 0 dBFS (Full Scale). |  |

### **5\. ⚠️ Common Gain Staging Mistakes**

| Mistake | Result |
| ----- | ----- |
| Setting input gain too high | Clipping and distortion |
| Mixing tracks too low | Excess noise when boosted |
| Overusing effects to fix gain | Introduces artifacts |
| Ignoring plugin input/output gain | Inconsistent signal chain |
| Pushing master fader to 0 dB | No headroom, distortion risk |

### **6\. 🛠️ How to Gain Stage Properly**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/DYsEV\_LVebA](https://youtu.be/DYsEV_LVebA)   
**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Set Input Gain (Preamp Stage)**: Adjust microphone or instrument gain so peaks hit \-18 dBFS to \-12 dBFS.  
2. **Normalize/Trim Audio Clips**: Use clip gain to ensure a consistent level before applying effects.  
3. **Use Metering Tools**: Watch your track and plugin input/output meters.  
4. **Adjust Plugin Levels**: Ensure plugins don’t output louder than they input (unless intentional).  
5. **Balance Using Faders (Mixing Stage)**: Mix with your faders instead of cranking gain inside effects.  
6. **Leave Headroom on the Master Bus**: Don’t exceed \-6 dBFS on the master fader before exporting for mastering.

### **7\. 🎚️ Tools That Assist with Gain Staging**

* **VU Meters**: Simulate analog meters for gain targeting  
* **Peak Meters**: Show max level; avoid 0 dBFS  
* **LUFS Meters**: Measure perceived loudness (used for streaming/podcasts)  
* **Trim/Gain Plugins**: Help adjust level at any stage  
* **Metering Suites**: iZotope Insight, Waves VU Meter, Klanghelm VUMT

### **8\. 🎤 Gain Staging in Podcasting & Voice**

* Record voice at \-16 to \-12 dBFS  
* Clean up with EQ/compression, then adjust output gain  
* Use loudness normalization to target \-16 LUFS (mono podcast standard)

### **9\. 🔁 Gain Staging vs. Volume**

| Term | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Gain | Input level (before processing) |
| Volume | Output level (after processing/fader) |
| **Note**: Gain affects the signal before it hits effects/plugins. Volume controls what the listener hears after processing. |  |

### **10\. ✅ Summary: Best Practices for Gain Staging**

* Aim for consistency, not perfection  
* Use tools like trim plugins and VU meters  
* Avoid clipping at every stage  
* Keep track of plugin input/output levels  
* **Remember**: Clean gain staging \= easier mixing & better sound

## **🎛️ Lecture Notes: EQ, Compression, Reverb**

YouTube: EQ, Compression, and Reverb Explained

### **1\. 🎚️ EQ (Equalization)**

#### **A. What is EQ?**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/bPAqLdnA7-0](https://youtu.be/bPAqLdnA7-0)   
EQ (Equalization) is the process of adjusting the balance of frequency content in an audio signal. It helps shape tone, correct imbalances, and create space in a mix.

#### **B. Frequency Ranges**

| Range | Frequency | Typical Sounds |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Sub-bass | 20–60 Hz | Rumble, power |
| Bass | 60–250 Hz | Kick drum, bass guitar |
| Low mids | 250–500 Hz | Warmth, muddiness |
| Mids | 500 Hz–2 kHz | Boxiness, clarity |
| Upper mids | 2–5 kHz | Presence, edge |
| Highs | 5–10 kHz | Air, brightness |
| Brilliance | 10–20 kHz | Sparkle, shimmer |

#### **C. Common EQ Types**

* **High-pass filter (HPF)**: Cuts low frequencies  
* **Low-pass filter (LPF)**: Cuts high frequencies  
* **Bell (Peak)**: Boosts or cuts a specific frequency  
* **Shelf (High/Low)**: Raises or lowers a full range  
* **Notch**: Cuts a very narrow band (e.g., hum)

#### **D. EQ Tips**

* Cut mud at 250–400 Hz  
* Reduce harshness at 2.5–4 kHz  
* Boost presence around 3–6 kHz  
* High-pass voice tracks below 80–100 Hz  
* Don’t boost and cut the same frequencies in different tracks

### **2\. 🔊 Compression**

#### **A. What is Compression?**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/cQD6bGE3JqM](https://youtu.be/cQD6bGE3JqM)   
Compression reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal. It makes loud parts quieter and quiet parts louder to create a more consistent and controlled sound.

#### **B. Key Compression Controls**

| Control | Function |
| ----- | ----- |
| Threshold | Level where compression starts |
| Ratio | How much compression is applied (e.g., 4:1) |
| Attack | How quickly compression kicks in |
| Release | How quickly it stops after signal drops |
| Knee | How smoothly compression is applied |
| Make-up Gain | Boosts output to compensate for loss |

#### **C. Types of Compression**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/WJ9uvaUi6IQ](https://youtu.be/WJ9uvaUi6IQ) 

* **Vocal Compression**: Adds consistency and intimacy  
* **Parallel Compression**: Mixes dry \+ compressed signal for punch  
* **Multiband Compression**: Compresses by frequency range  
* **Sidechain Compression**: Duck one track (e.g., music) when another plays (e.g., voice)

#### **D. Compression Tips**

* Use fast attack for controlling peaks  
* Use slower attack for punchiness  
* Avoid over-compression (can sound squashed or lifeless)  
* Always match input and output levels for fair comparison

### **3\. 🌊 Reverb**

#### **A. What is Reverb?**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/hnQeYasFXNM](https://youtu.be/hnQeYasFXNM)   
Reverb simulates the reflections of sound in a physical space (room, hall, plate, etc.), adding a sense of depth, distance, and natural space.

#### **B. Common Reverb Types**

| Type | Character |
| ----- | ----- |
| Room | Small, intimate, natural |
| Hall | Large, lush, ambient |
| Plate | Smooth, metallic, used on vocals |
| Spring | Boingy, vintage, used on guitars |
| Convolution | Uses real-world impulse responses |

#### **C. Reverb Controls**

| Control | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| Pre-delay | Delay before reverb starts (adds clarity) |
| Decay time | How long reverb tail lasts |
| Wet/Dry mix | Balance between dry (original) and wet (reverberated) signal |
| Size | Simulates the physical size of the space |
| Damping | Controls high-frequency rolloff in reverb tail |

#### **D. Reverb Tips**

* Use short reverb for clarity (podcast, speech)  
* Use longer reverb for dramatic or ambient feel  
* Pre-delay helps keep vocals upfront  
* Avoid clutter: use one or two shared reverb buses  
* High-pass the reverb return to avoid mud in low frequencies

### **4\. 🧠 How These Tools Work Together**

| Tool | Main Function | When to Use |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| EQ | Shapes tone by boosting/cutting frequencies | To fix or enhance specific frequency areas |
| Compression | Controls volume dynamics | To smooth vocals or control peaks |
| Reverb | Adds spatial depth and realism | To place sounds in a virtual space |
| **Order in signal chain matters**: EQ → Compression → Reverb (most common). But can change creatively depending on desired effect. |  |  |

### **5\. ✅ Summary**

* **EQ**: Adjusts what you hear  
* **Compression**: Adjusts how loud you hear it  
* **Reverb**: Adjusts where you hear it  
  Mastering these tools helps you:  
* Clean and shape sound  
* Control dynamics  
* Create emotion and depth in your mix

## **🎚️ Lecture Notes: Stereo Imaging**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/h1aNrMEi5XA](https://youtu.be/h1aNrMEi5XA) 

### **1\. 🎧 What Is Stereo Imaging?**

Stereo Imaging refers to the perceived spatial location of audio within the stereo field — left, center, right — and the width and depth of a mix. It determines where sounds appear to come from in a stereo environment and how wide or narrow your mix feels.

### **2\. 🖼️ The Stereo Field**

YouTube: Understanding the Stereo Field  
The stereo field consists of three key dimensions:

| Dimension | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Left to Right (Width) | Pan position — is the sound left, right, or center? |
| Front to Back (Depth) | Perceived distance — created by volume, EQ, and reverb |
| Top to Bottom (Height) | Implied by frequency content (not true spatial height) |

### **3\. 🎚️ Key Stereo Imaging Techniques**

#### **A. Panning**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/3nTF3bjXG6M](https://youtu.be/3nTF3bjXG6M) 

* Moves sounds between left and right speakers  
* Creates separation and clarity  
* **Rule of thumb**: Keep essential elements (like vocals, bass, kick) centered

#### **B. Stereo Widening**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/mwaZ85VeUoU](https://youtu.be/mwaZ85VeUoU) 

* Expands mix beyond the speakers  
* **Can be achieved via**:  
  * Doubling & panning  
  * Stereo effects (chorus, delays)  
  * Mid/Side processing  
  * Dedicated stereo imaging plugins

#### **C. Mono Compatibility**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/WL03pkG2cRA](https://youtu.be/WL03pkG2cRA) 

* Ensures mix doesn’t fall apart when summed to mono  
* Important for broadcast, phones, smart speakers

#### **D. Reverb & Delay**

	**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/XGSytDiGJl0](https://youtu.be/XGSytDiGJl0) 

* Reverb adds spatial depth; stereo reverbs create width  
* Delays panned differently in each ear create movement

### **4\. 📦 Tools Used for Stereo Imaging**

| Tool | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| Panner | Moves sound across stereo field |
| Stereo Wideners | Expand perceived width |
| Mid/Side EQ or Compression | Treat center vs. sides independently |
| Stereo Meters | Visualize balance and phase issues |
| Imaging Plugins | iZotope Ozone Imager, Waves S1, etc. |

### **5\. 🎙️ Use in Podcasts & Voice Production**

* **Voice**: Usually centered for clarity and focus  
* **Music bed/sound effects**: Can be panned or widened for immersion  
* **Binaural and spatial audio**: Simulate full 3D placement with headphones

### **6\. ⚠️ Common Stereo Imaging Mistakes**

| Mistake | Consequence |
| ----- | ----- |
| Excessive widening | Phase cancellation, hollow sound |
| Narrow mix | Feels flat, lacks excitement |
| Important sounds off-center | Distraction or imbalance |
| Ignoring mono compatibility | Sounds disappear in mono playback |
| Using stereo FX on bass | Can cause phase/clarity issues |

### **7\. 🧪 Practical Tips**

* Start in mono to balance levels and EQ; switch to stereo to place sounds  
* Keep low-end (kick, bass) in mono  
* Use stereo widening sparingly and musically  
* Check mix with a correlation meter to avoid phase issues  
* Use automation to move elements subtly across stereo field over time

### **8\. ✅ Summary: Best Practices**

| Do | Don’t |
| ----- | ----- |
| Use panning for clarity | Pan everything center |
| Center lead vocals and bass | Widen all instruments |
| Test in mono | Assume stereo is always better |
| Use stereo meters | Mix by ear only |
| Create width with intention | Overprocess your mix |

### **9\. 🧠 Key Terms to Remember**

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| Pan | Left-to-right positioning in stereo field |
| Width | Perceived separation between left/right |
| Depth | Sense of front/back space in a mix |
| Mid/Side (M/S) | Processing center and side channels separately |
| Phase Cancellation | Loss of signal when stereo collapses to mono |
