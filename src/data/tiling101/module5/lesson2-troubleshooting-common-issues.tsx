## **Section 5.2: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **A. Understanding and Fixing Lippage**

#### **What is Lippage?**

**YOUTUBE LINK:** [Understanding Lippage Issues](https://youtu.be/Z977qGdD7ds)

* Uneven tile edges creating height differences, noticeable in lighting or underfoot.

#### **Common Causes**

* Uneven substrate or insufficient leveling.
* Inconsistent adhesive application.
* Large-format tiles without leveling systems.

#### **Fixing Lippage**

* During Installation: Use leveling clips/wedges and check flatness per tile.
* After Installation: Smooth minor lippage with a rubbing stone or remove/reset tiles for severe cases.

### **Professional Insights**
Lippage, where tiles sit at uneven heights, compromises aesthetics and safety, particularly in high-traffic areas. Uneven substrates or inadequate adhesive coverage are common culprits, especially with large-format tiles that amplify imperfections. During installation, leveling systems ensure uniform heights, and frequent checks with a straightedge prevent issues. Post-installation, minor lippage can be smoothed with a rubbing stone, but severe cases require removing and resetting tiles with proper adhesive and leveling techniques. Addressing lippage early ensures a smooth, professional finish that enhances both appearance and functionality.

### **B. Uneven Grout Lines**

#### **Common Causes**

* Inconsistent spacer use or mixing spacer sizes.
* Variations in tile sizes, especially with handmade tiles.
* Rushed grouting leading to uneven application.

#### **Solutions**

* Prevention: Use spacers consistently, dry-fit tiles to adjust for size variations.
* Repairs: Re-grout thin lines or remove excess for overly wide joints.

### **Professional Insights**
Uneven grout lines detract from a tile installation's visual appeal, often resulting from inconsistent spacer use or tile size variations. During installation, uniform spacers and dry-fitting tiles help maintain consistent joint widths, especially with handmade tiles. Rushed grouting can exacerbate unevenness, so methodical application is key. For repairs, thin lines can be re-grouted with matching color, while overly wide joints may require careful removal and reapplication. These steps ensure a cohesive, professional look, maintaining the integrity of the design and enhancing the overall aesthetic of the tiled surface.

### **C. Loose Tiles**

#### **Common Causes**

* Poor adhesive coverage or incorrect adhesive type.
* Substrate movement or heavy traffic.
* Insufficient adhesive curing time.

#### **How to Fix Loose Tiles**

* Detection: Tap tiles to identify hollow sounds indicating looseness.
* Repair: Remove tile, clean substrate, reapply adhesive, and re-grout.

### **Professional Insights**
Loose tiles signal weak bonding, often due to inadequate adhesive coverage, substrate movement, or improper curing. Tapping tiles to detect hollow sounds identifies problem areas early. To repair, carefully remove the loose tile, scrape off old adhesive, and ensure a stable substrate. Reapply the correct adhesive, press the tile firmly, and allow full curing before re-grouting. This process restores structural integrity, preventing further detachment and maintaining a seamless appearance, ensuring the installation remains durable and visually consistent over time.
