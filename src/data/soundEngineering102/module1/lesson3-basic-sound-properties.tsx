      keyFeatures: 'Wave Distance and Pitch',
      description: `Wavelength, measured in meters, is the distance between wave peaks, inversely related to frequency (longer wavelength = lower pitch).

Wavelength influences how sound interacts with physical spaces, affecting room acoustics and microphone placement. The course provides virtual labs to explore wavelength's impact, helping learners optimize recording setups. Online accessibility allows students to experiment with these concepts at their own pace, ensuring they understand how wavelength shapes audio quality in various production environments.`

      keyFeatures: 'Wave Alignment and Interference',
      description: `Phase, measured in degrees, describes a wave's position in its cycle, critical for avoiding interference issues like sound cancellation in mixing.

Phase issues can degrade audio quality, especially in multi-microphone setups. Engineers must align phases to ensure clarity. The course offers DAW-based exercises to identify and correct phase problems, with online instructor feedback to guide learners. This practical training ensures students can manage phase effectively, producing clean and professional audio mixes.`

      keyFeatures: 'Sound Quality and Character',
      description: `Timbre, or tone color, distinguishes sounds with the same pitch and loudness, shaped by harmonics and overtones (e.g., violin vs. flute).

Timbre defines the unique character of sounds, crucial for creating distinctive audio in music or film. The course provides audio samples and DAW exercises to manipulate timbre, helping learners craft unique soundscapes. Online forums foster discussions on timbre's creative applications, ensuring students can use it to enhance the emotional impact of their audio projects.`

      keyFeatures: 'Longitudinal, Transverse, Complex, Pure Tone',
      description: `Sound waves include longitudinal (sound in air), transverse (in strings), complex (real-world sounds), and pure tones (single frequency).

Understanding wave types helps engineers select appropriate recording techniques. For example, longitudinal waves are key for air-based audio, while complex waves dominate real-world sounds. The course's interactive tutorials allow learners to analyze wave types in DAWs, with online feedback to refine their skills. This knowledge ensures students can handle diverse audio sources effectively in professional production.`

      description: `Sound intensity decreases with distance (doubling distance reduces intensity by 6 dB), impacting microphone placement and live sound.

The inverse square law is crucial for positioning microphones and speakers to capture or project sound effectively. The course provides simulations to demonstrate this principle, with online assignments to practice optimal setups. Peer reviews and instructor feedback help learners refine their techniques, ensuring they can manage sound intensity in various production scenarios for maximum clarity and impact.`
