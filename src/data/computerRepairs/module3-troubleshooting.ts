3. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**: Loads firmware settings
4. **Hardware Detection**: Identifies connected devices
5. **Boot Device Selection**: Determines boot priority
6. **Operating System Loading**: Transfers control to OS

### **Common POST Error Codes**
- **1-3 beeps**: Memory issues
- **4-7 beeps**: Motherboard problems
