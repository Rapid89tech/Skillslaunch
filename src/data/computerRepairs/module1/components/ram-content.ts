      <h4 class="font-semibold text-orange-800 mb-2">Your Computer's Fast Workspace</h4>
      <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm mb-3">Volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU uses while the system is running.</p>
      <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm mb-3">Think of Random Access Memory (RAM) like a very fast, temporary workspace for your computer. Here's why:</p>
      
      <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-orange-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm"><strong>âš¡ Fast:</strong> When your computer needs to do something right now (like open an app, edit a document, or browse the web), it loads the necessary information into RAM. RAM is much, much faster than your hard drive (where your programs and files are permanently stored), so it can access that information almost instantly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-orange-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm"><strong>ðŸ”„ Temporary:</strong> RAM only holds information while your computer is turned on. The moment you switch off your computer, everything in RAM is erased. It's like clearing your desk at the end of the day â€“ all the papers you were working on are gone. If you want to save something permanently, you need to save it to your hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-orange-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm"><strong>ðŸ’¼ Workspace:</strong> The more RAM your computer has, the more "workspace" it has. This means it can handle more programs running at the same time, or work with larger files, without slowing down. If you have too little RAM, your computer will have to constantly swap information between the slow hard drive and the small RAM, which makes everything feel sluggish.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-orange-700 text-sm mt-3"><strong>In short:</strong> RAM is where your computer actively works on things. It's fast for immediate tasks but forgets everything when the power goes off.</p>
