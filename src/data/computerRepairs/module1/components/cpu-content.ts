      <h4 class="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">The Brain of Your Computer</h4>
      <p class="text-green-700 text-sm mb-3">Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU processes instructions and performs calculations. Imagine your computer is like a big, busy kitchen, and you're making a delicious cake!</p>
      <p class="text-green-700 text-sm mb-3">The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is like the chef in that kitchen. Here's why:</p>

        <div class="bg-green-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-green-700 text-sm"><strong>üß† The Brain of the Kitchen:</strong> The chef is the one who reads the recipe (that's like the program on the computer), figures out what to do next, and tells everyone else what to do. Without the chef, nothing would get done!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-green-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-green-700 text-sm"><strong>‚ö° Super Fast Thinker:</strong> The chef thinks really, really fast. When you tell the computer to open a game or watch a video, the CPU quickly understands what you want and starts working on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-green-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-green-700 text-sm"><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Doing the Work:</strong> The chef does all the important jobs, like mixing the ingredients, cracking the eggs, and making sure everything is cooked just right. The CPU does all the "thinking" and "calculating" for the computer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-green-100 p-3 rounded">
          <p class="text-green-700 text-sm"><strong>üéØ Lots of Jobs at Once:</strong> A really good chef can sometimes do a few things at the same time, like stir the batter while checking the oven. Modern CPUs are like that ‚Äì they have special parts that let them work on different parts of a task all at once so things happen even faster!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-green-700 text-sm mt-3">So, every time you click on something, type a letter, or play a game on your computer, it's the amazing CPU (the chef!) that's making it all happen!</p>

      <h5 class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">CPU Cores Explained</h5>
      <p class="text-yellow-700 text-sm mb-2">Remember our computer kitchen and the CPU being the chef? Well, imagine that some chefs are so good, they're like super chefs! Instead of just having one brain to think with, they actually have multiple mini-brains inside their head that can all think and work at the same time. These "mini-brains" are called cores.</p>
      
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-3 mt-3">
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded border">
          <strong class="text-yellow-800">One Core:</strong>
          <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">If your chef only has one core, they can only do one step of the recipe at a time. They'll mix the batter, then put it in the oven, then decorate the cake. One thing after another.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded border">
          <strong class="text-yellow-800">Dual-Core:</strong>
          <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">If your chef has two cores, it's like they have two heads that can work together! One head can be mixing the batter, while the other head is already preparing the icing. They can do two things at the same time, which makes the cake get done faster!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded border">
          <strong class="text-yellow-800">Quad-Core:</strong>
          <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Now imagine a chef with four cores! They're super efficient. One core can be chopping fruit, another mixing batter, another checking the oven, and another cleaning up! They can juggle many tasks at once.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-yellow-700 text-sm mt-3">So, the more cores a CPU has, the more different jobs it can work on at the very same time. This is why computers with more cores feel faster, especially when you're doing many things at once, like playing a game, listening to music, and Browse the internet all at the same time!</p>
