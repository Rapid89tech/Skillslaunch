## Introduction to Pipe Wrenches
Pipe wrenches are essential tools for any plumber, designed specifically to grip and turn pipes and fittings. They provide the leverage needed to tighten or loosen threaded connections.

## Types of Pipe Wrenches
- **Straight pipe wrenches**: Most common type for general use
- **Offset pipe wrenches**: Angled head for working in tight spaces
- **Chain pipe wrenches**: For larger diameter pipes
- **Strap wrenches**: For delicate finishes

## Proper Usage
- Always pull, don't push, when using a pipe wrench
- Use two wrenches when working with threaded connections
- Keep the wrench perpendicular to the pipe for maximum grip
- Regular maintenance and lubrication of the adjusting mechanism`
