        textContent: `# üö∞ Components of a Water Supply System

## Cold Water Supply
- **Direct source**: Comes directly from the municipal supply or a private well
- **Main components**: Main water line, service shut-off valve, pressure-reducing valve (if needed), and cold water distribution piping

## Hot Water Supply
- **Water heating**: Cold water feeds into a water heater (tank or tankless)
- **Distribution**: Hot water distribution lines carry heated water to fixtures such as sinks, showers, dishwashers, and washing machines

## Typical Materials Used
- **Piping materials**: Copper, PEX, CPVC, and galvanized steel`

        textContent: `# üöΩ Basics of Drainage Systems

## Purpose
- **Wastewater removal**: Remove wastewater from sinks, showers, toilets, and appliances
- **System connection**: Direct it to a municipal sewer or septic system

## Key Components
- **Drain pipes**: Carry water and waste away from fixtures
- **Waste stacks**: Vertical pipes that transport wastewater to the building's main drain
- **Main sewer line**: Connects the building's drainage system to the municipal sewer or septic tank

## Types of Wastewater
- **Gray water**: From sinks, showers, and laundry
- **Black water**: From toilets and kitchen sinks`

        textContent: `# üåä Sewer and Wastewater Management

## Wastewater Disposal Methods
- **Municipal sewer systems**: Wastewater is treated at a centralized facility
- **Septic systems**: On-site treatment through a septic tank and drain field

## Common Materials for Drainage Pipes
- **Pipe materials**: PVC, ABS, cast iron, and clay

## Code and Regulatory Requirements
- **Proper slope**: For gravity flow (typically 1/4 inch per foot)
- **Approved materials**: And fittings
- **Cleanouts**: For easy access in case of blockages`

        textContent: `# üå°Ô∏è Hot and Cold Water Distribution

## Cold Water Distribution
- **Universal supply**: Supplies water to all fixtures, appliances, and outdoor taps
- **Consistent service**: Ensures consistent pressure and flow to meet household or building demands

## Hot Water Distribution
- **Temperature maintenance**: Maintains proper temperature and pressure for comfortable usage
- **Recirculation systems**: Includes recirculation lines in larger systems to provide instant hot water and reduce wastage

## Balancing Pressure and Flow
- **Proper sizing**: Proper pipe sizing ensures steady pressure, even when multiple fixtures are in use
- **Contamination prevention**: Backflow prevention devices prevent contamination of the cold water supply`

        textContent: `# üí® Purpose of Venting Systems

## Preventing Traps from Losing Water
- **Trap function**: Each fixture has a trap (U-shaped bend) to prevent sewer gases from entering the building
- **Pressure maintenance**: Venting maintains atmospheric pressure, ensuring that water stays in the trap

## Supporting Drainage Flow
- **Air entry**: Vents allow air to enter the plumbing system, preventing negative pressure that could disrupt water flow

## Releasing Sewer Gases
- **Safe direction**: Vents safely direct sewer gases outside the building`

        textContent: `# üèóÔ∏è Types of Venting Systems

## Individual Vents
- **Dedicated venting**: Each fixture has its own vent that connects to the main vent stack

## Common Vents
- **Shared venting**: One vent shared by multiple fixtures

## Main Vent Stack
- **Primary vent**: Vertical pipe that extends through the roof, releasing gases to the outside

## Design Considerations and Regulations
- **Minimum diameter**: Vent pipe diameter requirements
- **Distance limitations**: From the trap to the vent
- **Roof requirements**: Height and location for vent terminations`
