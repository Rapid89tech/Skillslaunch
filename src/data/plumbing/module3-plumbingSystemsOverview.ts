        textContent: `# üö∞ Section 2: Water Supply Systems: Hot and Cold Water Distribution (45 minutes)

## A. Components of a Water Supply System

### Cold Water Supply:
- **Direct source**: Comes directly from the municipal supply or a private well
- **Main components**: Main water line, service shut-off valve, pressure-reducing valve (if needed), and cold water distribution piping

### Hot Water Supply:
- **Water heating**: Cold water feeds into a water heater (tank or tankless)
- **Distribution**: Hot water distribution lines carry heated water to fixtures such as sinks, showers, dishwashers, and washing machines

### Typical Materials Used:
- **Piping materials**: Copper, PEX, CPVC, and galvanized steel

**Reference**: Rwanda Polytechnic - Plumbing Level 3 - Installing a Cold and Hot Water System - 1 of 3

## B. Hot and Cold Water Distribution

### Cold Water Distribution:
- **Universal supply**: Supplies water to all fixtures, appliances, and outdoor taps
- **Consistent service**: Ensures consistent pressure and flow to meet household or building demands

### Hot Water Distribution:
- **Temperature maintenance**: Maintains proper temperature and pressure for comfortable usage
- **Recirculation systems**: Includes recirculation lines in larger systems to provide instant hot water and reduce wastage

### Balancing Pressure and Flow:
- **Proper sizing**: Proper pipe sizing ensures steady pressure, even when multiple fixtures are in use
- **Contamination prevention**: Backflow prevention devices prevent contamination of the cold water supply

        textContent: `# üöΩ Section 3: Drainage Systems: Sewer and Wastewater Management (45 minutes)

## A. Basics of Drainage Systems

### Purpose:
- **Wastewater removal**: Remove wastewater from sinks, showers, toilets, and appliances
- **System connection**: Direct it to a municipal sewer or septic system

### Key Components:
- **Drain pipes**: Carry water and waste away from fixtures
- **Waste stacks**: Vertical pipes that transport wastewater to the building's main drain
- **Main sewer line**: Connects the building's drainage system to the municipal sewer or septic tank

**Reference**: Introduction to Drainage System (sanitary and storm drainage system)

## B. Sewer and Wastewater Management

### Types of Wastewater:
- **Gray water**: From sinks, showers, and laundry
- **Black water**: From toilets and kitchen sinks

### Wastewater Disposal Methods:
- **Municipal sewer systems**: Wastewater is treated at a centralized facility
- **Septic systems**: On-site treatment through a septic tank and drain field

### Common Materials for Drainage Pipes:
- **Pipe materials**: PVC, ABS, cast iron, and clay

### Code and Regulatory Requirements:
- **Proper slope**: For gravity flow (typically 1/4 inch per foot)
- **Approved materials**: And fittings
- **Cleanouts**: For easy access in case of blockages

        textContent: `# üí® Section 4: Venting Systems and Their Importance in Plumbing (30 minutes)

## A. Purpose of Venting Systems

### Preventing Traps from Losing Water:
- **Trap function**: Each fixture has a trap (U-shaped bend) to prevent sewer gases from entering the building
- **Pressure maintenance**: Venting maintains atmospheric pressure, ensuring that water stays in the trap

### Supporting Drainage Flow:
- **Air entry**: Vents allow air to enter the plumbing system, preventing negative pressure that could disrupt water flow

### Releasing Sewer Gases:
- **Safe direction**: Vents safely direct sewer gases outside the building

**Reference**: What are plumbing vents for...and why you NEED them

## B. Types of Venting Systems

### Individual Vents:
- **Dedicated venting**: Each fixture has its own vent that connects to the main vent stack

### Common Vents:
- **Shared venting**: One vent shared by multiple fixtures

### Main Vent Stack:
- **Primary vent**: Vertical pipe that extends through the roof, releasing gases to the outside

**Reference**: IFGC Chapter 5 Introduction - Vent Categories and Types

## C. Design Considerations and Regulations

### Code Requirements:
- **Minimum diameter**: Vent pipe diameter requirements
- **Distance limitations**: From the trap to the vent
- **Roof requirements**: Height and location for vent terminations

### Maintaining Clear Vents:
- **Regular inspection**: Inspect vents regularly for blockages (e.g., debris, bird nests)
- **Protection**: Keep roof vent openings protected but not sealed

## Conclusion and Q&A (30 minutes)

### A. Recap Key Points:
- Residential plumbing is simpler and smaller scale, while commercial and industrial systems are larger and more complex
- Water supply systems ensure consistent hot and cold water distribution to fixtures
- Drainage systems handle the safe and effective removal of wastewater to sewers or septic systems
- Venting systems are essential for maintaining drainage flow, preventing sewer gases, and ensuring trap integrity

### B. Interactive Q&A Session:
- Invite participants to ask questions about specific systems or components
- Discuss real-world examples of different plumbing systems
- Provide additional resources for further reading and practical application

### C. Practice Assignments:
- Have participants identify and label the water supply and drainage components in their own home or workplace
- Assign a research task: find a recent plumbing code change in their region and explain its impact on system design
- Ask participants to describe how venting helps maintain water flow and prevents sewer gas odors

By understanding the overview of plumbing systems, participants will gain foundational knowledge to further explore specialized topics and hands-on skills.`
