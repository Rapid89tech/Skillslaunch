## Water Supply Systems
### Function and Requirements
- Deliver potable water from municipal source, well, or water tank to fixtures and appliances
- Must maintain adequate pressure for consistent flow throughout the building
- Include hot and cold water distribution networks

### Key Components
- **Main water line**: Primary connection from source to building
- **Distribution network**: Pipes carrying water throughout building
- **Pressure regulation**: Maintaining consistent pressure at all fixtures
- **Backflow prevention**: Protecting water supply from contamination

## Drainage and Waste Removal
### Gravity-Based Systems
- Rely on downward slopes to remove wastewater efficiently
- Use pipe sizing and slope calculations for optimal flow
- Include both blackwater (toilets) and greywater (sinks, showers) systems

### Venting Systems
- Prevent blockages and ensure smooth drainage
- Allow air into drainage system to prevent vacuum formation
- Protect trap seals from being siphoned away

## Cross-Connection Control
### Purpose
- Prevents contamination of potable water supply
- Separates supply lines from wastewater or non-potable sources
- Essential for public health protection

### Methods
- **Backflow prevention devices**: Check valves and vacuum breakers
- **Air gaps**: Physical separation between supply and waste
- **Check valves**: Allow flow in one direction only`

        textContent: `# üíß Water Flow Mechanics

## Pressure and Flow
### Water Pressure Fundamentals
- Measured in pounds per square inch (PSI)
- Drives water through pipes and to fixtures
- Typical residential pressure: 40-80 PSI (ideal: 50-60 PSI)

### Flow Rate Considerations
- Measured in gallons per minute (GPM)
- Depends on pipe size, pressure, and fixture demand
- Must balance pressure and flow for system efficiency

## Friction Loss and Velocity
### Friction Loss
- Water moving through pipes encounters resistance
- Increases with pipe length, fittings, and flow rate
- Must be calculated for proper system design

### Water Velocity
- Speed of water flow through pipes
- Must be balanced to avoid:
  - Noisy pipes (too high velocity)
  - Poor performance (too low velocity)
  - Excessive wear on system components

## Hot and Cold Water Distribution
### Hot Water Systems
- Include water heaters (tank or tankless)
- Recirculation loops for instant hot water
- Insulation to maintain temperature and reduce energy loss

### Cold Water Systems
- Supply drinking water and feed fixtures
- Include outdoor taps and irrigation connections
- Must maintain pressure throughout system`

- **Tees**: Branch connections for multiple fixtures
- **Couplings**: Join straight pipe sections

### Control Valves
- **Ball valves**: Quarter-turn operation, reliable shut-off
- **Gate valves**: Full-flow when open, gradual shut-off
- **Check valves**: Prevent backflow, protect system integrity

## Fixtures and Appliances
### End-Point Components
