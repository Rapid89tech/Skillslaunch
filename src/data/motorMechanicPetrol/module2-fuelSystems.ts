              <ul>
                <li>A carburetor mixes air and fuel before it enters the engine's intake manifold</li>
                <li>Uses vacuum suction from the engine to draw in air and fuel</li>

              <p>The air-fuel mixture is the ratio of air (oxygen) to fuel (petrol) supplied to the engine's combustion chamber. This mixture must be just right for optimal combustion.</p>
              <ul>

              <h3>üß† How Engines Manage Mixture</h3>
              
              <h4>Carbureted Engines:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Use mechanical jets and valves to control mixture</li>
                <li>Carburetors use jets and needles to control fuel flow, but require frequent manual tuning</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Fuel-Injected Engines:</h4>
              <p>Use sensors like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Oxygen sensor (O2/Lambda sensor)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>These allow the ECU (Engine Control Unit) to automatically adjust the mixture in real time.</p>
