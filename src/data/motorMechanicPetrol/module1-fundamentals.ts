              <h3>Section 1: Understanding the Four-Stroke Engine Cycle (45 minutes)</h3>
              
              <h4>A. The Four-Stroke Cycle</h4>
              <h5>Overview:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>A four-stroke engine is the most common type used in petrol vehicles</li>
                <li>It completes a full cycle in four strokes of the piston: intake, compression, power, and exhaust</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h5>The Four Strokes in Detail:</h5>
              
              <h4>1. Intake Stroke (Suck)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The intake valve opens, allowing a mixture of air and fuel to enter the cylinder</li>
                <li>The piston moves downward, increasing the cylinder volume and drawing in the air-fuel mixture</li>
                <li><strong>Key Point:</strong> Only the intake valve is open; exhaust valve stays shut</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>2. Compression Stroke (Squash)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Both intake and exhaust valves close</li>
                <li>The piston moves upward, compressing the air-fuel mixture into a smaller volume</li>
                <li><strong>Key Point:</strong> High compression = more power</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3. Power Stroke (Bang)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from the spark plug</li>
                <li>The resulting explosion pushes the piston downward, creating mechanical energy</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is the only stroke that produces power to turn the crankshaft</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>4. Exhaust Stroke (Blow)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward again, expelling exhaust gases from the cylinder</li>
                <li><strong>Key Point:</strong> Clears the chamber for the next intake stroke</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="key-takeaway">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The cycle repeats with precise timing to produce smooth, continuous engine power.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The four-stroke cycleâ€”intake, compression, power, exhaustâ€”is fundamental to how petrol engines operate</li>
                <li>Each engine component plays a specific role: the pistons transfer combustion energy to the crankshaft, the camshaft controls valve timing, and the cylinder block and head house these critical parts</li>
                <li>Petrol engines differ from diesel engines in ignition method, compression ratios, fuel type, and applications</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>B. Practice and Outcomes:</h4>
              <p>By the end of this lecture, participants will have a foundational understanding of petrol engine operation, the purpose of its key components, and how it differs from diesel engine technology. This knowledge sets the stage for more advanced topics in engine maintenance and repair.</p>

            correct: 0,
            explanation: 'The four-stroke cycle follows the sequence: Intake (drawing in air-fuel mixture), Compression (compressing the mixture), Power (ignition and expansion), and Exhaust (expelling burnt gases).'
          },

            question: 'Which component of a petrol engine converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotational motion?',

            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: 'The crankshaft converts the reciprocating (up-and-down) motion of the pistons into rotational motion that can be used to drive the vehicle.'
          },
          {
            question: 'What is the primary function of the spark plug in a petrol engine?',
            options: [
              'To control the flow of air into the engine',
              'To ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder',
              'To regulate the timing of the valves',
              'To reduce engine temperature during combustion'
            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: 'The spark plug generates the electrical spark that ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture in the cylinder during the power stroke.'

            correct: 1,
            explanation: 'Petrol engines typically have compression ratios between 8:1 and 12:1, which is lower than diesel engines to prevent knock and allow for proper spark ignition.'
