  questions: [
    {
      question: "What is the primary function of a drive belt?",
      options: [
        "To synchronize the crankshaft and camshaft",
        "To power accessories like the alternator and power steering pump",
        "To regulate engine temperature",
        "To lubricate engine components"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What indicates a drive belt needs replacement?",
      options: [
        "A rusty appearance",
        "Cracks, fraying, or glazing on the belt surface",
        "A loose water pump",
        "A shiny camshaft"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "How often should a timing belt typically be replaced?",
      options: [
        "Every 10,000–15,000 kilometres",
        "Every 90,000–150,000 kilometres or 5–7 years",
        "Every 20,000–25,000 kilometres",
        "Only when the engine fails"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What tool is used to check drive belt tension?",
      options: [
        "A torque wrench",
        "A belt tension gauge or manual deflection check",
        "A coolant tester",
        "A spark plug socket"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What is a common symptom of a failing timing belt?",
      options: [
        "Increased fuel efficiency",
        "Engine misfires or sudden failure to start",
        "Improved power steering performance",
        "Cleaner exhaust emissions"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "Why should the water pump be replaced with the timing belt?",
      options: [
        "It improves fuel economy",
        "It's often driven by the timing belt and can fail, damaging the new belt",
        "It prevents oil leaks",
        "It reduces belt tension"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What should you check during a drive belt inspection?",
      options: [
        "Coolant levels",
        "Pulleys for wear or debris and belt for cracks or glazing",
        "Spark plug gaps",
        "Oil viscosity"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What risk does a snapped timing belt pose in an interference engine?",
      options: [
        "Reduced fuel consumption",
        "Minor performance loss",
        "Severe engine damage like bent valves or damaged pistons",
        "Increased accessory performance"
      ],
      correct: 2
    },
    {
      question: "What does a squealing noise from the engine during startup typically indicate?",
      options: [
        "A faulty spark plug",
        "A loose or glazed drive belt or weak tensioner",
        "Low coolant levels",
        "A clogged air filter"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "Why is it important to inspect pulleys during a drive belt replacement?",
      options: [
        "To check for coolant contamination",
        "To ensure they are free of wear or debris that could damage the new belt",
        "To measure their temperature",
        "To adjust their tension"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What should be done before inspecting a timing belt?",
      options: [
        "Run the engine to warm it up",
        "Ensure the engine is cold and off, and remove the timing cover",
        "Check the oil level",
        "Replace the drive belt first"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of aligning crankshaft and camshaft timing marks during a timing belt replacement?",
      options: [
        "To increase engine power",
        "To ensure proper valve timing and prevent engine damage",
        "To reduce belt tension",
        "To improve fuel efficiency"
      ],
      correct: 1
    }
