      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "How can you safely identify a fuel line leak?",
      options: [
        "By removing the fuel pump and examining it",
        "By looking for wet spots, stains, or strong gasoline odour",
        "By checking the oil dipstick for discoloration",
        "By examining the radiator for coolant levels"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of a fuel system cleaner?",
      options: [
        "To increase the viscosity of the fuel",
        "To remove carbon deposits and varnish from injectors and combustion chambers",
        "To lower the octane rating of the fuel",
        "To lubricate the timing chain"
      ],
      correct: 1
    },
    {
      question: "When is a good time to use a fuel system cleaner?",
      options: [
        "Every time you change your oil",
        "Every 5,000–10,000 kilometres or after vehicle storage",
        "Only after a breakdown occurs",
        "Never, as fuel system cleaners are not needed"
