              Fuel system cleaners are chemical additives that dissolve carbon deposits, varnish, and gum in fuel injectors, intake valves, and combustion chambers, restoring efficient fuel delivery and combustion. They improve fuel economy (by up to 10%), reduce emissions (e.g., hydrocarbons), and prevent clogs that cause misfires or hesitation. In South Africa, where fuel quality varies, cleaners like those with polyetheramine (PEA) are essential for preventing injector buildup after 5,000–10,000 kilometres.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Learners will explore cleaner effects through virtual simulations, visualizing deposit removal. Regular use extends component life, preventing injector replacements costing R2,000 each. Mechanics mastering cleaner use ensure smoother performance and client satisfaction, especially for high-mileage vehicles. The AI voice tutor can explain cleaner chemistry, their impact on emissions, or suitability for local fuels, enhancing maintenance decisions.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Types of Fuel System Cleaners</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Fuel system cleaners include injector cleaners (e.g., Chevron Techron, targeting nozzle clogs), complete system cleaners (e.g., BG 44K, cleaning injectors, valves, and chambers), fuel stabilizers (e.g., STA-BIL, preventing ethanol corrosion), and octane boosters with cleaning agents (e.g., Royal Purple Max Boost, for performance engines). Each type addresses specific issues, like injector cleaners restoring spray patterns or stabilizers preventing gumming in stored vehicles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Learners will compare cleaners in virtual scenarios, assessing suitability for South African conditions, where ethanol blends degrade fuel systems faster. Using the wrong cleaner (e.g., diesel-only in petrol engines) can damage components, costing R5,000+. Mechanics mastering cleaner selection optimize engine performance and longevity. The AI voice tutor can explain cleaner types, their ingredients, or vehicle-specific applications, ensuring informed choices.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">When and How to Use Fuel System Cleaners</h3>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
              <p className="text-sm text-blue-800">Video Reference: https://youtu.be/GdjfmaPaNjk?si=3VlnfXR_LvGH_v1u</p>
            </div>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Fuel system cleaners should be used every 5,000–10,000 kilometres or before emissions tests, long trips, or after vehicle storage, especially in South Africa's humid climates where moisture causes corrosion. Add the cleaner to a nearly full tank (per dosage instructions, e.g., 300 ml for 60 litres), drive normally to circulate it, and avoid overuse to prevent engine damage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Learners will practice application in virtual scenarios, ensuring correct dosing. For example, using Sea Foam before an oil change prevents crankcase contamination. Neglecting cleaners can lead to injector clogs, reducing fuel economy by 10% or triggering repairs costing R3,000+. Mechanics mastering this task maintain efficient engines, enhancing client fuel savings. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through dosing, timing, or cleaner selection for specific symptoms, ensuring effective use.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Benefits of Regular Use</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Regular use of fuel system cleaners improves fuel efficiency (2–10% mileage gains), restores power and throttle response, reduces emissions (e.g., 20% lower CO), and extends component life (e.g., injectors, pumps). They prevent clogs, remove water in ethanol-heavy South African fuels, and ease cold starts in colder regions like the Free State.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Learners will explore benefits in virtual scenarios, analyzing performance improvements. For high-mileage vehicles, cleaners restore lost performance, saving R5,000+ in repairs. Neglecting cleaners risks injector failure or emissions test failures, costing R2,000–R10,000. Mechanics mastering regular cleaner use ensure reliable, eco-friendly vehicles, boosting client trust. The AI voice tutor can explain efficiency gains, emissions compliance, or cleaner benefits for older engines, enhancing maintenance strategies.
