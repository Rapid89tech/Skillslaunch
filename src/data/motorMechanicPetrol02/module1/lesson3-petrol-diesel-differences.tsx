    <h2>Differences Between Petrol and Diesel Engines</h2>
    
    <p>Understanding the differences between petrol and diesel engines is crucial for mechanics working with various vehicle types. Each engine type has distinct characteristics that affect their operation, maintenance, and applications.</p>
    
    <h3>Combustion Process</h3>
    <p>Petrol engines ignite a pre-mixed air-fuel mixture using a spark plug at compression ratios of 8:1 to 12:1, while diesel engines use high compression (14:1 to 20:1) to ignite fuel injected into hot, compressed air. This fundamental difference affects engine design, performance, and maintenance requirements, with petrol engines offering smoother operation and diesel engines providing greater torque.</p>
    
    <p>The combustion process defines the operational characteristics of petrol and diesel engines, influencing their efficiency, power delivery, and maintenance needs. Petrol engines rely on precise spark timing for controlled ignition, while diesel's compression ignition requires robust components to handle higher pressures. Learners will compare these processes through virtual simulations, observing how ignition methods impact combustion efficiency. This knowledge is critical for mechanics servicing diverse vehicles, enabling them to diagnose issues like petrol engine misfires or diesel injector failures with precision. The AI voice tutor can clarify combustion differences, offering guidance on troubleshooting spark plug versus injector issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Fuel and Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Petrol engines use lighter, more volatile fuel, providing quick throttle response but lower fuel efficiency, while diesel engines use denser fuel with higher energy content, offering better mileage and torque for heavy-duty applications. Fuel properties influence combustion efficiency, emissions, and engine design, with petrol suited for speed and diesel for endurance.</p>
    
    <p>Fuel type and efficiency are pivotal for engine performance and application, affecting everything from vehicle range to environmental impact. Learners will analyze fuel properties through virtual experiments, adjusting air-fuel ratios to optimize combustion. Petrol's volatility supports high-RPM performance, while diesel's energy density excels in long-haul efficiency. Mechanics mastering these differences can address fuel-related issues, such as poor economy or emissions failures, tailoring repairs to specific vehicle needs. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through optimizing fuel systems, explaining how to adjust injectors or diagnose carburetor issues for maximum efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>Application and Durability</h3>
    <p>Petrol engines power passenger cars, motorcycles, and light vehicles, offering high RPMs and responsiveness, while diesel engines are used in trucks, buses, and industrial equipment, designed for durability under heavy loads. These applications reflect their design priorities, with petrol engines prioritizing speed and diesel engines focusing on longevity and torque.</p>
    
    <p>The distinct applications of petrol and diesel engines shape their maintenance and repair strategies, with petrol engines requiring frequent spark plug checks and diesel engines needing robust component servicing. Learners will explore real-world use cases, such as petrol engines in sports cars versus diesel in heavy machinery, through case studies. This understanding enables mechanics to tailor repairs, such as reinforcing diesel components for heavy use or optimizing petrol engines for performance. The AI voice tutor can provide insights into application-specific maintenance, such as servicing diesel injectors or tuning petrol ignition systems.</p>
    
    <h3>Fuel Injection Systems</h3>
    <p>Petrol engines use port or direct fuel injection for precise fuel delivery, while older models rely on carburetors for mechanical mixing. Diesel engines use high-pressure direct injection to atomize fuel into compressed air. Injection systems impact efficiency, emissions, and maintenance complexity, with modern systems requiring electronic diagnostics.</p>
    
    <p>Fuel injection systems have revolutionized engine efficiency, replacing carburetors with precise, electronically controlled delivery in modern petrol and diesel engines. Learners will compare these systems through virtual simulations, adjusting injection parameters to optimize performance. Petrol's lower-pressure systems are easier to maintain, while diesel's high-pressure systems require specialized tools. Mechanics mastering these systems can diagnose and repair issues like clogged injectors or faulty ECUs, ensuring compliance with emissions standards. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through injector cleaning or ECU reprogramming, offering practical solutions for complex repairs.</p>
