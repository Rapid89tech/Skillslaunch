      <h2>Role of Coolant</h2>
      <p>Coolant, a 50/50 mix of ethylene/propylene glycol and water, regulates engine temperature by absorbing and transferring heat, prevents freezing in cold climates, and protects against corrosion in the radiator, water pump, and engine block. It ensures the engine operates within safe temperature ranges (80–100°C), avoiding damage like warped heads or blown gaskets.</p>
      
      <p>Learners will explore coolant properties in virtual simulations, understanding its role in heat dissipation and corrosion prevention. Low or degraded coolant can cause overheating, leading to repairs costing thousands of rands. Mechanics mastering coolant maintenance ensure reliable cooling, extending engine life. The AI voice tutor can explain coolant types or diagnose overheating causes, offering practical insights for workshops.</p>

      <h2>Checking Coolant Levels</h2>
      <p>Checking coolant when the engine is cold involves inspecting the reservoir's "MIN" and "MAX" marks or the radiator's level (near the neck). Topping up with a 50/50 coolant-water mix maintains system pressure and prevents overheating. Low levels may indicate leaks, while overfilling can cause pressure buildup, damaging hoses.</p>
      
      <p>Learners will practice checks in virtual scenarios, identifying issues like air bubbles or low levels. Regular checks, ideally monthly, ensure cooling efficiency, especially in hot South African climates. Mechanics mastering this task prevent costly overheating damage, ensuring vehicle reliability. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through safe checking procedures or spotting leaks, ensuring accurate maintenance.</p>

      <h2>Testing Coolant Condition</h2>
      <p>Coolant condition is assessed for rust, cloudiness, or particles, indicating corrosion or contamination (e.g., milky coolant suggests a head gasket leak). A coolant tester measures freeze/boil protection (e.g., -37°C to 129°C), ensuring system reliability. Rusty coolant can clog radiators, reducing cooling efficiency, while contaminated coolant may corrode components.</p>
      
      <p>Learners will use virtual testers to evaluate coolant, identifying issues like scale buildup. This skill helps mechanics diagnose cooling system failures early, preventing major repairs. The AI voice tutor can explain tester usage or contamination signs, enhancing diagnostic precision for real-world applications.</p>

      <h2>Flushing and Replacing Coolant</h2>
      <p>Coolant flushes, needed every 50,000–100,000 kilometres, involve draining old coolant, flushing the system with water or a cleaning solution, and refilling with fresh coolant. Running the engine with the radiator cap off removes air bubbles, ensuring proper circulation. Improper flushes can leave air pockets, causing overheating, or old coolant can corrode components.</p>
      
      <p>Learners will simulate flushes, practicing techniques to avoid blockages. This task maintains cooling efficiency, critical for engine longevity. Mechanics mastering flushes ensure reliable systems, preventing costly failures. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through flush procedures or air bubble removal, ensuring precision.</p>

      <h2>Safety in Coolant Handling</h2>
      <p>Coolant handling requires PPE like gloves and goggles, as it's toxic and can cause skin irritation or burns if hot. Never open a hot radiator cap to avoid scalding from pressurized steam. Used coolant must be disposed of at recycling centres per South African regulations (e.g., Hazardous Waste Management guidelines), and spills cleaned immediately to prevent slips or environmental harm.</p>
      
      <p>Learners will practice safe handling in virtual scenarios, using PPE and proper disposal methods. Mishandling can lead to injuries or fines, making safety critical. Mechanics mastering these practices ensure safe, compliant workshops. The AI voice tutor can explain safe handling protocols or local disposal rules, ensuring adherence to standards.</p>
