#### **Thermostat**

**YOUTUBE VIDEO:** [Thermostat Operation](https://youtu.be/PGkSfPbGr3Y)

- **Temperature Regulation:** Opens to allow coolant flow at high temperatures and closes to warm the engine during startup.
- **Operation:** A wax-filled or electronic valve responds to coolant temperature, typically opening at 195°F to allow radiator circulation.
- **Location:** Positioned between the engine and radiator, controlling coolant flow to optimize temperature.
- **Failure Symptoms:** A stuck-open thermostat causes slow warm-up and poor fuel efficiency, while a stuck-closed one leads to overheating.
- **Types:** Available in standard, high-performance, or programmable variants tailored to specific engine requirements.
- **Calibration:** Designed to balance rapid warm-up with overheating prevention, critical for emission control.

The thermostat is a precision component that regulates coolant flow to maintain optimal engine temperature. By closing during cold starts, it accelerates warm-up, reducing wear and emissions. Once the engine reaches operating temperature, it opens to allow coolant to circulate to the radiator, preventing overheating. A stuck thermostat, whether open or closed, disrupts this balance, leading to inefficiencies or engine damage. Different thermostat types cater to specific vehicle needs, such as high-performance engines requiring lower opening temperatures. Technicians must understand thermostat operation and failure symptoms to diagnose issues and ensure efficient engine performance across varying driving conditions.
