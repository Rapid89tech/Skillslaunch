    textContent: `# ðŸ”§ Key Components of the Injection System

*Essential parts that ensure precise fuel delivery.*

* **Fuel Pump**: Draws and pressurizes fuel from the tank to supply injectors.  
* **Fuel Injectors**: Atomize fuel into a fine mist for thorough combustion.  
* **Fuel Lines and Rails**: Distribute fuel, with common rails ensuring consistent pressure.  
* **Sensors and Control Units**: Monitor and adjust pressure, temperature, and timing in modern systems.  
* **Filters**: Remove contaminants to protect injectors and pumps.  
* **Pressure Regulators**: Maintain optimal fuel pressure for consistent delivery.


The diesel fuel injection system comprises critical components working in unison to deliver fuel efficiently. The fuel pump, either mechanical in older engines or electronically controlled in modern ones, draws fuel from the tank and pressurizes it up to 2,000 bar for delivery to injectors. Fuel injectors atomize fuel into a fine mist, ensuring thorough mixing with compressed air for complete combustion, reducing emissions. Fuel lines and common rails distribute fuel evenly, with modern common rail systems maintaining consistent high pressure for precision. Sensors and electronic control units monitor parameters like pressure and temperature, adjusting injection for optimal performance. Filters protect components from contaminants, while pressure regulators ensure stable delivery. Mechanics must maintain these components to prevent clogs, leaks, or pressure issues, ensuring reliable engine operation across diverse applications.`
