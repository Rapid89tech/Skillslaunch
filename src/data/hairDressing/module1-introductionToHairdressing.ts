# Online Lecture: Introduction to Hairdressing
## 1.1 Understanding Hair Structure and Types

Hairdressing is both an art and a science. To become a skilled hair professional, it is essential to understand the structure of hair, different hair types, and key characteristics like porosity and elasticity.

## üß¨ Hair Structure: Layers & Roles

**Cuticle:** The tough, outer "shingle" layer formed of overlapping keratin cells. It protects the hair shaft and controls how moisture and substances get in or out.

**Cortex:** The thick middle layer made of fibrous keratin, providing strength, elasticity (via disulfide bonds), and housing melanin which gives hair its color.

**Medulla:** The soft inner core present in coarser hair; it's less structured and not always found in fine hair.

## üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hair Types: Shape & Texture

Hair types range from Straight ‚Üí Wavy ‚Üí Curly ‚Üí Coily and are mainly determined by the shape of the hair follicle:
- Round follicles ‚Üí straight hair
- Oval/slanted follicles ‚Üí wavy to curly hair
- Flattened, twisted follicles ‚Üí coily/kinky hair

The cortex shape (round vs flattened) dictates curl pattern.

## üíß Hair Porosity & Elasticity

**Porosity** describes how readily hair absorbs and retains moisture‚Äîit's controlled by the cuticle's openness:
- **High porosity:** Gaps/open cuticle; absorbs moisture fast but loses it quickly ‚Üí frizz, dryness. Common in curly/coily hair or hair exposed to heat/chemicals.
- **Low porosity:** Tightly closed cuticle; resists moisture entering but retains it well.
- **Medium (normal):** Balanced absorption and retention‚Äîideal.

**Elasticity** is the hair's ability to stretch and return, thanks to cortex protein bonds:
- **Hydrogen bonds:** Temporary, affected by water/heat‚Äîallow temporary styling.
- **Disulfide bonds:** Stronger, permanent; give hair its natural shape and resilience.

## üîÑ Recap: Structure ‚Üí Type ‚Üí Porosity ‚Üí Elasticity
Each hair strand is a layered structure whose shape determines your hair type:
- The cuticle regulates moisture flow (porosity).
- The cortex gives strength, color, curl pattern, and elasticity.
- The medulla, when present, is just a soft core in thicker strands.

# Anatomy of Hair: Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla

Hair is composed of three main layers that determine its strength, texture, and overall health.

## Cuticle
- The outermost layer of the hair shaft.
- Made of overlapping transparent scales that protect the inner layers.
- Responsible for hair shine and smoothness.
- Can be damaged by excessive heat, chemicals, and rough brushing.

## Cortex
- The thickest layer of the hair strand.
- Contains keratin proteins and melanin, which give hair its strength, elasticity, and color.
- Determines the hair's ability to be styled, curled, or straightened.
- Chemical treatments like coloring and perming affect the cortex.

## Medulla
- The innermost layer, present in some hair types.
- Composed of soft, loosely connected cells.
- More common in thick or coarse hair, often absent in fine hair.

# Different Hair Types: Straight, Wavy, Curly, Coily

Hair types vary based on genetic factors and are classified into four primary categories:

## Straight Hair (Type 1)
- Naturally smooth and shiny due to the intact cuticle layer.
- Resistant to curling but can become oily quickly.
- Requires volumizing products for added texture.

## Wavy Hair (Type 2)
- Falls between straight and curly hair.
- Forms loose S-shaped waves.
- Can be prone to frizz and benefits from lightweight moisturizing products.

## Curly Hair (Type 3)
- Defined curls ranging from loose loops to tight spirals.
- Prone to dryness due to the cuticle not lying flat.
- Requires hydrating products and minimal heat styling.

## Coily Hair (Type 4)
- Tightly coiled or kinky with a zig-zag pattern.
- Naturally dry and fragile due to minimal moisture retention.
- Needs deep conditioning and protective styling to maintain health.

# Hair Porosity and Elasticity

These characteristics determine how hair reacts to products and styling techniques.

## Hair Porosity
Refers to the hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture.

- **Low Porosity:** Cuticles are tightly closed; resistant to moisture and products.
- **Medium Porosity:** Well-balanced moisture absorption and retention.
- **High Porosity:** Cuticles are lifted; absorbs moisture quickly but loses it fast.

Proper hair care techniques include using lightweight products for low porosity hair and sealing moisture for high porosity hair.

## Hair Elasticity
Measures hair's ability to stretch and return to its original shape.

- **High Elasticity:** Strong and resistant to breakage.
- **Medium Elasticity:** Some flexibility, moderate strength.
- **Low Elasticity:** Weak, prone to snapping and breakage.

Strengthening treatments, such as protein-based conditioners, help improve elasticity.

# Conclusion

Understanding hair structure, types, porosity, and elasticity is fundamental in hairdressing. By identifying these characteristics, hair professionals can choose the right products, techniques, and treatments to enhance hair health and styling outcomes. Mastery of these concepts lays the foundation for becoming a skilled hairdresser.
