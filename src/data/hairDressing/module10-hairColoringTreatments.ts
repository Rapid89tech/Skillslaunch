## Lesson Objectives:
- Understand the fundamentals of hair color levels and tones
- Explore different types of hair color products and their uses
- Learn basic application techniques including foiling, balayage, and ombre
- Understand hair treatment and care principles

## Section 10.1: Hair Coloring Basics

### Part 1: Introduction to Hair Coloring

Hair coloring is a fundamental skill in the beauty industry that allows stylists to transform clients' appearance, express creativity, and help people achieve their desired look. Understanding color theory, product types, and application techniques is essential for successful hair coloring services.

### Part 2: Understanding Hair Color Levels and Tones üé®

#### Color Levels
**The Numbering System:**
- **Level 1:** Black (darkest)
- **Level 2-3:** Dark brown
- **Level 4-5:** Medium brown
- **Level 6-7:** Light brown to dark blonde
- **Level 8-9:** Medium to light blonde
- **Level 10:** Lightest blonde (lightest)

**How Levels Affect Coloring:**
- Starting level determines what colors can be achieved
- Lightening is required to go from darker to lighter levels
- Each level represents the amount of melanin (natural pigment) in hair
- Understanding levels helps predict color results and processing time

#### Tones and Undertones
**Three Main Tone Categories:**
- **Warm Tones:** Golden, honey, copper, red undertones
- **Cool Tones:** Ash, beige, violet, blue undertones  
- **Neutral Tones:** Balanced between warm and cool

**Understanding Undertones:**
- Natural hair contains underlying pigments that emerge during lightening
- Red-orange undertones appear in levels 1-3
- Orange undertones appear in levels 4-5
- Yellow-orange undertones appear in levels 6-7
- Yellow undertones appear in levels 8-10

**Tone Selection Impact:**
- Tones can neutralize unwanted undertones
- Warm tones enhance golden and red hues
- Cool tones counteract brassiness and yellow
- Proper tone selection ensures desired color results

### Part 3: Types of Hair Color üí°

#### Permanent Color
**How It Works:**
- Contains ammonia and peroxide
- Penetrates the hair shaft and permanently alters pigment
- Lifts natural color and deposits new color simultaneously
- Creates lasting chemical change in hair structure

**Best Uses:**
- Covering gray hair completely
- Creating dramatic color changes
- Going lighter or darker by multiple levels
- Achieving long-lasting, vibrant results

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Root touch-ups every 4-6 weeks as hair grows
- Color-safe shampoo and conditioner
- Regular deep conditioning treatments
- UV protection to prevent fading

#### Semi-Permanent Color
**How It Works:**
- No ammonia, low or no peroxide
- Coats the outer layer of hair (cuticle)
- Does not lift natural pigment
- Gradually fades with each wash

**Best Uses:**
- Adding shine and vibrancy to existing color
- Refreshing faded permanent color
- Experimenting with new tones
- Blending gray hair (not complete coverage)
- Enhancing natural hair color

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Lasts 4-6 weeks or 6-12 shampoos
- Fades gradually and evenly
- Can be reapplied as needed
- Gentler on hair than permanent color

#### Temporary Color
**How It Works:**
- Deposits pigment only on hair surface
- No penetration into hair shaft
- No chemical alteration of natural pigment
- Washes out after 1-3 shampoos

**Best Uses:**
- Special occasions and events
- Vibrant fashion colors
- Testing colors before permanent commitment
- Adding temporary highlights or accent colors
- Creative and artistic color applications

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- No long-term commitment
- Fades out easily with regular washing
- Can stain light-colored hair
- May require clarifying shampoo for complete removal

### Part 4: Application Techniques üñåÔ∏è

#### Foiling Technique
**Method:**
- Uses aluminum foil to isolate hair sections
- Allows for precise color placement
- Enables multiple colors in one application
- Controls processing time for each section

**Benefits:**
- Precise placement and control
- Even color distribution
- Ability to create multiple dimensions
- Professional, salon-quality results

**Common Uses:**
- Traditional highlights and lowlights
- Multi-dimensional color effects
- Corrective color work
- Creating contrast and depth

**Application Steps:**
1. Section hair into workable areas
2. Weave or slice hair sections based on desired effect
3. Place foil under hair section
4. Apply color product evenly
5. Fold foil to secure and separate sections
6. Process according to manufacturer's instructions

#### Balayage Technique
**Method:**
- French word meaning "to sweep"
- Freehand painting technique
- Color applied to surface of hair sections
- Creates natural, sun-kissed effect

**Benefits:**
- Softer, more natural regrowth lines
- Lower maintenance than traditional highlights
- Customizable placement and intensity
- Modern, effortless appearance

**Common Uses:**
- Natural-looking highlights
- Seamless color transitions
- Beach wave and textured styles
- Subtle color enhancement

**Application Tips:**
- Paint color from mid-length to ends
- Focus on areas where sun would naturally lighten
- Vary thickness and placement for natural effect
- Use paddle or brush for application

#### Ombre Technique
**Method:**
- Gradual transition from dark roots to light ends
- Creates horizontal color graduation
- Can be subtle or dramatic
- Usually involves lightening bottom half of hair

**Benefits:**
- Striking visual contrast
- Customizable intensity and placement  
- Versatile styling options
- Low maintenance at roots

**Common Uses:**
- Bold color transformations
- Subtle lightening of ends
- Creative color combinations
- Modern, edgy looks

**Variation Techniques:**
- **Sombr√©:** Subtle ombre with softer transition
- **Reverse Ombre:** Light roots to dark ends
- **Color Ombre:** Using fashion colors instead of natural tones
