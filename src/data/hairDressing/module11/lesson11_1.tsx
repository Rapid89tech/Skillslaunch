      <h2>🧪 Chemical Processes in Hairdressing</h2>

      <h3>✅ Understanding Chemical Processes</h3>
      <p>Chemical processes are fundamental to professional hairdressing, allowing stylists to permanently alter hair texture, create stunning curls, straighten hair, and correct color issues. This comprehensive lesson covers the essential chemical treatments every professional stylist should master.</p>

      <h3>✅ 🎯 Lesson Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the fundamentals of perming and relaxing hair</li>
        <li>Explore keratin treatments and smoothing systems</li>
        <li>Learn color correction techniques for professional results</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ 💫 Perming Hair</h3>

      <h4>What Is Perming?</h4>
      <p>A chemical process that alters hair's natural texture, creating curls or waves by restructuring the protein bonds in hair using perm rods and chemical solutions (alkaline or acid-based).</p>

      <h4>The Perming Process:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Hair is wound onto perm rods</li>
        <li>Waving lotion is applied, breaking down natural bonds</li>
        <li>Hair is reshaped into the curl pattern of the rods</li>
        <li>Neutralizer is applied to set the new shape and restore pH balance</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>⚠️ Key Considerations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hair health and porosity assessment</li>
        <li>Proper timing to avoid over-processing</li>
        <li>Always conduct strand tests</li>
        <li>Use quality products and follow manufacturer guidelines</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ 🌿 Relaxing Hair</h3>

      <h4>What Is Relaxing?</h4>
      <p>A chemical process used to straighten curly or textured hair by breaking down disulfide bonds in the hair shaft, using sodium hydroxide (lye) or calcium hydroxide (no-lye) relaxers.</p>

      <h4>The Relaxing Process:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply relaxer evenly, avoiding scalp contact</li>
        <li>Smooth hair to desired straightness</li>
        <li>Rinse thoroughly and neutralize to halt the chemical process</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>✅ Best Practices:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Always neutralize properly</li>
        <li>Avoid overlapping applications on previously relaxed hair</li>
        <li>Use post-relaxer treatments to restore moisture and protein</li>
        <li>Consider scalp sensitivity and timing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ ✨ Keratin Treatments & Smoothing Systems</h3>

      <h4>Keratin Treatments:</h4>
      <p>Treatments that infuse hair with keratin (natural protein) to reduce frizz, improve manageability, and add shine. Applied with heat sealing using a flat iron.</p>

      <h5>Benefits:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Smoother, more manageable hair</li>
        <li>Reduces blow-drying time</li>
        <li>Lasts several weeks to months</li>
        <li>Adds natural shine</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Considerations:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Some contain formaldehyde compounds</li>
        <li>Results vary by hair type</li>
        <li>Requires professional application</li>
        <li>Use sulfate-free maintenance products</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Smoothing Systems:</h4>
      <p>Non-permanent treatments designed to eliminate frizz and enhance shine without completely altering natural curl patterns. Gentler alternative with temporary results lasting several weeks.</p>

      <h3>✅ 🎨 Color Correction Techniques</h3>

      <h4>What Is Color Correction?</h4>
      <p>The process of fixing unwanted hair color results, such as brassy tones, uneven application, or incorrect shades. Often requires multiple steps and sessions.</p>

      <h4>Common Issues & Solutions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brassy or Warm Tones:</strong> Use blue or purple-based toners to neutralize orange or yellow undertones</li>
        <li><strong>Overly Dark Results:</strong> Gradual lightening with gentle lightener; use filler before darkening too-light hair</li>
        <li><strong>Uneven Color:</strong> Strand tests and sectioning to target specific areas; layer glazes for seamless blending</li>
        <li><strong>Faded or Patchy Color:</strong> Refresh with semi-permanent glosses; deep condition for even application</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>🔑 Key Considerations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Always start with thorough consultation</li>
        <li>Work slowly and in stages</li>
        <li>Use gentle, high-quality products</li>
        <li>Understand client's hair history and goals</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ 📚 Professional Development</h3>
      <p>Chemical processes require continuous learning and practice. Consider pursuing advanced certifications and staying updated with the latest techniques and products.</p>

      <h4>📖 Recommended Resources:</h4>
      <ul>
