  questions: [
    {
      question: 'What is the primary purpose of perming hair?',
      options: [
        'To straighten the hair permanently',
        'To create curls or waves by altering the hair\'s protein structure',
        'To improve hair\'s natural shine and texture'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Perming creates curls or waves by restructuring the protein bonds in hair using chemical solutions and perm rods.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which type of relaxer is known to be more gentle on the scalp?',
      options: [
        'Sodium hydroxide (lye) relaxer',
        'Ammonium thioglycolate relaxer',
        'Calcium hydroxide (no-lye) relaxer'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'No-lye relaxers (calcium hydroxide) are generally considered gentler on the scalp compared to lye relaxers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a key benefit of a keratin treatment?',
      options: [
        'Permanently straightens the hair',
        'Reduces frizz and adds shine without altering natural curl patterns',
        'Changes the natural hair color'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Keratin treatments reduce frizz and add shine while maintaining the hair\'s natural texture, unlike permanent straightening.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the main difference between a keratin treatment and a smoothing system?',
      options: [
        'Keratin treatments contain more chemicals than smoothing systems',
        'Smoothing systems provide longer-lasting results than keratin treatments',
        'Smoothing systems tend to be less intense and more temporary than keratin treatments'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'Smoothing systems are generally gentler and more temporary than keratin treatments, offering shorter-term results.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the most common issue addressed by color correction?',
      options: [
        'Enhancing natural shine',
        'Fixing unwanted brassy or uneven tones',
        'Completely changing the hair\'s texture'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Color correction primarily addresses unwanted brassy tones, uneven color application, and incorrect shades.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which technique is best for neutralizing orange or yellow undertones?',
      options: [
        'Applying a blue or purple-based toner',
        'Using a high-lift permanent color',
        'Adding a filler before lightening'
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation: 'Blue and purple-based toners neutralize orange and yellow undertones respectively, following color theory principles.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is a strand test important before performing chemical treatments?',
      options: [
        'It helps determine the best application method',
        'It shows how the hair will react to the treatment without risking all the hair',
        'It reduces the overall processing time'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Strand tests allow you to assess how the hair will react to chemicals without risking damage to the entire head of hair.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should you always do after applying a relaxer?',
      options: [
        'Rinse and neutralize to stop the chemical process',
        'Apply heat to help the relaxer set',
        'Use a deep conditioning treatment immediately'
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation: 'Neutralizing is crucial after relaxing to stop the chemical process and prevent over-processing or damage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which of the following is NOT a key step in color correction?',
      options: [
        'Applying a pre-lightening agent',
        'Strand testing for accurate results',
        'Skipping the conditioning step to avoid altering the new color'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'Conditioning is essential in color correction to maintain hair health and ensure even color application.'
    },
    {
      question: 'When performing a keratin treatment, why is it important to follow manufacturer\'s instructions carefully?',
      options: [
        'To avoid overprocessing the hair',
        'To ensure the product lasts as long as possible',
        'Both a and b'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'Following manufacturer instructions prevents overprocessing and ensures optimal, long-lasting results from keratin treatments.'
    }
