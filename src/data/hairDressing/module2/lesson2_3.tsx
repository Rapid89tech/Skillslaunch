      <h2>ðŸ”¥ Heat Styling Tools</h2>
      
      <h3>âœ… Blow Dryer (Hair Dryer)</h3>
      
      <h4>Ionic Dryers</h4>
      <p>Ionic blow dryers emit negative ions that break down water molecules, reducing drying time and minimizing frizz. They're especially effective for thick or coarse hair, leaving it smoother and shinier. Ionic technology also helps protect hair from heat damage, making it a preferred choice for professional stylists.</p>

      <h4>Attachments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concentrator Nozzle:</strong> Directs airflow for precise blowouts, allowing stylists to smooth hair and create sleek finishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Diffuser:</strong> Disperses heat gently, enhancing natural curls and waves without causing frizz. It's essential for clients with curly or wavy hair who want to maintain definition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Flat Iron (Hair Straightener)</h3>
      
      <h4>Ceramic Plates</h4>
      <p>Ceramic flat irons provide even heat distribution, reducing the risk of hot spots and minimizing hair damage. They're suitable for most hair types and help achieve smooth, shiny results with less effort.</p>

      <h4>Titanium Plates</h4>
      <p>Titanium flat irons heat up quickly and maintain consistent temperatures, making them ideal for thick or coarse hair. They deliver professional results and are durable enough for frequent use.</p>

      <h4>Adjustable Heat Settings</h4>
      <p>Adjustable heat settings are crucial for working with different hair types and textures. Lower temperatures protect fine or damaged hair, while higher settings are effective for thick, resistant hair.</p>

      <h3>âœ… Curling Iron/Wand</h3>
      
      <h4>Curling Iron (With Clamp)</h4>
      <p>Curling irons with clamps create structured, spiral curls and are easy to use for beginners. The clamp holds hair in place, ensuring even heat distribution and consistent curls.</p>

      <h4>Curling Wand (No Clamp)</h4>
      <p>Curling wands create beachy, loose waves and are favored for their versatility. Without a clamp, they allow for more natural-looking curls and are less likely to leave creases.</p>

      <h4>Barrel Sizes</h4>
      <p>Smaller barrels produce tight curls, while larger barrels create soft, voluminous waves. Choosing the right size allows stylists to customize the look for each client.</p>
