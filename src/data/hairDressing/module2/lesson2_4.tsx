      <h2>ðŸ§¼ Protective Gear and Hygiene Essentials</h2>
      
      <h3>âœ… Personal & Client Protection</h3>
      
      <h4>Capes</h4>
      <p>Capes are essential for keeping hair, water, and chemicals off the client's clothes during cuts, coloring, and styling. They provide a barrier that ensures comfort and cleanliness, enhancing the overall salon experience.</p>

      <h4>Gloves</h4>
      <p>Gloves protect the stylist's hands from harsh chemicals, dyes, and potential allergens. They're a must-have for any chemical treatment, ensuring both safety and hygiene for the stylist and client.</p>

      <h4>Aprons</h4>
      <p>Aprons shield the stylist from water, hair, and product stains, keeping their clothing clean and professional. They also provide extra pockets for holding small tools, improving efficiency during services.</p>

      <h4>Neck Strips</h4>
      <p>Neck strips create a hygienic barrier between the client's neck and the cape, preventing irritation and maintaining cleanliness. They're disposable and should be replaced for each client.</p>

      <h3>âœ… Hygiene & Maintenance</h3>
      
      <h4>Barbicide (Disinfectant Jar)</h4>
      <p>Barbicide is a powerful disinfectant used to sanitize combs, shears, and razors between clients. Regular use prevents the spread of bacteria and infections, ensuring a safe salon environment.</p>

      <h4>UV Sterilizer Cabinet</h4>
      <p>UV sterilizer cabinets use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and viruses on metal tools. They're a standard in professional salons, providing an extra layer of protection for both clients and staff.</p>

      <h4>Tool Cleaning Brushes & Sprays</h4>
      <p>Specialized brushes and sprays keep clippers, shears, and other tools clean and sharp. Regular maintenance extends the life of equipment and ensures optimal performance.</p>

      <h4>Alcohol Wipes</h4>
      <p>Alcohol wipes are a quick and effective way to disinfect surfaces, handles, and tools between clients. They help maintain a clean, sanitary workspace and reduce the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

      <h3>âœ… Key Takeaways for Salon Professionals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sanitation & Sterilization:</strong> Clean tools with soap and water before disinfecting. Soak metal tools in EPA-approved solutions like Barbicide, and use UV cabinets or autoclaves for sterilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling Chemicals & Tools:</strong> Always wear gloves and masks when handling chemicals. Store disinfectants safely, and ensure tools are dry before storing to prevent rust and bacterial growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining Workspace Hygiene:</strong> Sanitize benches, chairs, and surfaces between clients. Use single-use items when possible, and keep tools organized to prevent cross-contamination.</li>
