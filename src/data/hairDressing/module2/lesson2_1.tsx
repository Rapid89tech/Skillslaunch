      <h2>ðŸ§µ Types of Combs and Brushes</h2>
      
      <h3>âœ… Combs</h3>
      
      <h4>Tail Comb (Rat-tail Comb)</h4>
      <p>The tail comb features a long, pointed handle, making it perfect for sectioning, parting, and creating precise lines in the hair. It's a staple for tasks like braiding, applying color, or creating intricate updos. The fine teeth help smooth hair, while the tail allows for clean, sharp separations, which is essential for professional styling and color application.</p>

      <h4>Wide-Tooth Comb</h4>
      <p>Wide-tooth combs are designed to gently detangle wet or curly hair without causing breakage or pain. The spaced-out teeth glide through knots, minimizing damage and split ends. This comb is especially useful for distributing conditioner evenly and is a must-have for clients with thick, textured, or fragile hair.</p>

      <h4>Cutting Comb</h4>
      <p>A cutting comb typically has both wide and fine teeth, allowing stylists to control tension and achieve even, precise cuts. The dual sides make it versatile for different hair types and cutting techniques, ensuring smooth blending and texturizing. It's an essential tool for achieving professional, balanced haircuts.</p>

      <h4>Barber Comb</h4>
      <p>Barber combs are shorter and have tightly spaced teeth, making them ideal for clipper-over-comb techniques and short haircuts. Their design allows for close control and precision, which is crucial for fades, tapers, and other detailed barbering work.</p>

      <h4>Teasing Comb</h4>
      <p>Teasing combs are used to backcomb hair, creating volume and lift at the roots. This tool is essential for updos, retro styles, or any look that requires extra body. The fine teeth and pointed end help section hair and build structure without causing excessive damage.</p>

      <h3>âœ… Brushes</h3>
      
      <h4>Paddle Brush</h4>
      <p>Paddle brushes are broad and flat, making them perfect for detangling and smoothing long, straight hair. The wide surface area covers more hair with each stroke, reducing frizz and static. This brush is ideal for achieving sleek, polished looks and is gentle enough for daily use.</p>

      <h4>Round Brush</h4>
      <p>Round brushes are used with blow dryers to create volume, curls, and bends in the hair. Available in various barrel sizes, they allow stylists to customize the curl tightness or add body to flat hair. The round shape helps lift hair at the roots and smooth the cuticle for a shiny finish.</p>

      <h4>Vent Brush</h4>
      <p>Vent brushes have a hollow or slotted design that allows air to flow through, speeding up the blow-drying process. They add lift at the roots and are great for creating volume without excessive heat exposure. The open structure also makes them easy to clean and maintain.</p>

      <h4>Boar Bristle Brush</h4>
      <p>Boar bristle brushes are gentle on the scalp and help distribute natural oils from root to tip, promoting shine and reducing frizz. They're especially beneficial for fine or thin hair, as they smooth the hair cuticle without causing breakage.</p>

      <h4>Denman Brush</h4>
      <p>The Denman brush is popular for defining curls, especially in natural hair care routines. Its closely spaced, flexible bristles help detangle and shape curls without disrupting their pattern, making it a favorite among curly-haired clients.</p>
