      <h2>✂️ Scissors and Razors for Cutting</h2>
      
      <h3>✅ Hairdressing Scissors</h3>
      
      <h4>Straight Scissors (Cutting Shears)</h4>
      <p>Straight scissors are the backbone of any stylist's toolkit, used for clean, blunt cuts and precision trimming. Their sharp, straight blades allow for accurate line work, making them ideal for creating classic bobs, trims, and sharp edges. High-quality shears reduce hand fatigue and ensure smooth, effortless cutting.</p>

      <h4>Thinning Shears (Texturizing Scissors)</h4>
      <p>Thinning shears have notched blades that remove bulk and blend layers without altering the overall length. They're essential for softening lines, reducing weight in thick hair, and creating seamless transitions between layers. Proper use of thinning shears results in natural-looking, manageable hair.</p>

      <h4>Offset Scissors</h4>
      <p>Offset scissors are ergonomically designed to reduce hand and wrist strain during long cutting sessions. The handle's offset position allows for a more natural grip, improving comfort and control. These are especially beneficial for stylists who cut hair for extended periods.</p>

      <h3>✅ Razors</h3>
      
      <h4>Straight Edge Razor (Feather Razor)</h4>
      <p>Straight edge razors are used for soft, textured finishes and layered cuts. They're perfect for creating shaggy, wispy looks and adding movement to the hair. Razor cutting requires skill and confidence, as the angle and pressure determine the final texture and avoid frizz.</p>

      <h4>Safety Razors for Hair</h4>
      <p>Safety razors provide more control and reduce the risk of nicks, making them suitable for softer ends and controlled thinning. They're often used for shaping and refining hairlines or adding subtle texture to the ends.</p>
