## 1. French, Dutch, and Fishtail Braids

Braiding techniques vary in complexity and style, allowing for creative and unique hair designs.

### 1.1 French Braid ‚úÖ

The French braid is a classic, elegant style that involves gradually incorporating hair into the braid as it moves down the scalp.

**Technique:**
- Start with a small section of hair at the crown and divide it into three equal parts
- Cross the right section over the middle, then the left section over the new middle
- Add small sections of hair to each piece before crossing over
- Continue until all hair is incorporated, then secure with an elastic band

**When to Use:** Classic schoolgirl styles, workout hair, polished day looks

**Styling Tip:** Keep tension even and gather small sections for a neater look

### 1.2 Dutch Braid (Inside-Out Braid) ‚úÖ

Also known as an inverted French braid, the Dutch braid creates a 3D effect by braiding under rather than over.

**Technique:**
- Similar to the French braid but cross the sections under the middle instead of over
- Continue braiding, adding small sections until the hair is fully incorporated
- Secure the braid at the ends

**When to Use:** Edgier looks, double braids, or base braids for updos and festival styles

**Styling Tip:** Pancake (gently tug) the outer edges of the braid for a fuller appearance

### 1.3 Fishtail Braid ‚úÖ

A fishtail braid creates a woven, intricate appearance, perfect for sleek and stylish looks.

**Technique:**
- Divide hair into two equal sections
- Take a small strand from the outside of the right section and cross it over to the left section
- Repeat on the opposite side
- Continue until the braid is complete, then secure with an elastic band

**When to Use:** Boho, bridal, or elegant casual looks

**Styling Tip:** Works best on slightly dirty or textured hair. Use a light mist of hairspray or texturizing spray for grip
