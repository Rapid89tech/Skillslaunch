## 1. Texturizing and Thinning Techniques

### 1.1 What is Texturizing?

Texturizing is the process of adding dimension, movement, and softness to a haircut.
- Used to remove bulk from thick hair or create a wispy effect in fine hair
- Helps in blending layers seamlessly

### 1.2 Common Texturizing Techniques

**Point Cutting:**
- Cutting into the ends of the hair at an angle to create softness and remove blunt lines

**Slide Cutting:**
- Using scissors to slide along the hair strand to blend layers and create a natural finish

**Notching:**
- Similar to point cutting but with deeper cuts for more dramatic texture

### 1.3 Thinning Techniques

**Using Thinning Shears:**
- Removes bulk while maintaining overall shape

**Slithering:**
- Running the shears down a section of hair to create soft movement

**Chipping:**
- Cutting at various angles to break up solid lines and add texture

## 2. Razor Cutting

### 2.1 What is Razor Cutting?

Razor cutting involves using a straight razor instead of scissors for soft, feathered ends.
- Ideal for creating movement in thick or coarse hair
- Works well with layered cuts and shaggy styles

### 2.2 Razor Cutting Techniques

**Straight Razor Cut:**
- Performed with a sharp razor for a blended, airy look

**Razor Slashing:**
- Using the razor to carve deep texture into the hair

**Softening Edges:**
- A technique used to eliminate harsh lines, making the cut appear more natural

### 2.3 Benefits and Considerations

**Benefits:**
- Adds volume and movement
- Reduces weight in thick hair without creating harsh layers

**Considerations:**
- Not suitable for extremely fine or fragile hair, as it can cause excessive thinning

## 3. Precision and Freehand Cutting

### 3.1 Precision Cutting

Precision cutting requires sharp, clean lines and symmetrical shaping.
- Used for classic bobs, blunt cuts, and geometric styles
- Common in high-fashion and editorial haircuts

### 3.2 Techniques for Precision Cutting

**Blunt Cutting:**
- Creates strong, defined lines, often used for bobs and sharp-edged styles

**Graduation:**
- Builds weight and shape, commonly used in stacked bobs and A-line cuts

**Sectioning and Guiding:**
- Ensures symmetry and evenness throughout the haircut

### 3.3 Freehand Cutting

Freehand cutting involves cutting without rigid sectioning, relying on visual judgment.
- Often used for curly and textured hair to enhance the natural shape
- Helps create effortless, natural-looking styles with movement

## Professional Tips

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Advanced Cutting Fundamentals:
- Always use sharp, professional tools for clean cuts
