      <h2>üéÄ Braiding and Updos</h2>
      
      <p>Braiding and updo techniques are essential for any hairstylist, offering both everyday practicality and the ability to create show-stopping looks for special occasions. Mastery of these skills allows stylists to craft everything from simple, secure braids for daily wear to intricate, elegant updos for weddings, proms, and red-carpet events. Understanding the structure, tension, and finishing of these styles is key to ensuring they are both beautiful and long-lasting.</p>

      <h3>‚úÖ 1. French, Dutch, and Fishtail Braids</h3>
      <p>Braiding techniques vary in complexity and style, allowing for creative and unique hair designs.</p>

      <h4>1.1 French Braid ‚úÖ</h4>
      <p>The French braid is a classic, elegant style that involves gradually incorporating hair into the braid as it moves down the scalp.</p>

      <h5>Technique:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a small section of hair at the crown and divide it into three equal parts</li>
        <li>Cross the right section over the middle, then the left section over the new middle</li>
        <li>Add small sections of hair to each piece before crossing over</li>
        <li>Continue until all hair is incorporated, then secure with an elastic band</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>When to Use:</h5>
      <p>Classic schoolgirl styles, workout hair, polished day looks</p>

      <h5>Styling Tip:</h5>
      <p>Keep tension even and gather small sections for a neater look</p>

      <h4>1.2 Dutch Braid (Inside-Out Braid) ‚úÖ</h4>
      <p>Also known as an inverted French braid, the Dutch braid creates a 3D effect by braiding under rather than over.</p>

      <h5>Technique:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Similar to the French braid but cross the sections under the middle instead of over</li>
        <li>Continue braiding, adding small sections until the hair is fully incorporated</li>
        <li>Secure the braid at the ends</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Edgier looks, double braids, or base braids for updos and festival styles</p>

      <p>Pancake (gently tug) the outer edges of the braid for a fuller appearance</p>

      <p>A fishtail braid creates a woven, intricate appearance, perfect for sleek and stylish looks.</p>

      <h5>Technique:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Divide hair into two equal sections</li>
        <li>Take a small strand from the outside of the right section and cross it over to the left section</li>
        <li>Repeat on the opposite side</li>
        <li>Continue until the braid is complete, then secure with an elastic band</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>When to Use:</h5>
      <p>Boho, bridal, or elegant casual looks</p>
