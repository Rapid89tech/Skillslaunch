            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: 'Light pressure with a well-wrung damp sponge, wiping diagonally across tiles, prevents disturbing the grout in the joints while effectively removing surface haze.'

            correct: 2,
            explanation: 'The optimal time to clean grout haze is when the grout has firmed up but not fully hardened, using a clean, damp sponge with gentle pressure.'
