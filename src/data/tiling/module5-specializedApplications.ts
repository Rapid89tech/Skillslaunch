# 5.2 Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Understanding Lippage

<div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-r-xl mb-6 shadow-lg">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-red-800 mb-3 flex items-center text-lg">
    <span class="text-2xl mr-3">üìè</span>
    What is Lippage?
  </h4>
  <p>‚Ä¢ Lippage occurs when the edge of one tile sits higher or lower than the adjacent tile, creating an uneven surface</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ Often noticeable in reflective lighting or when walking barefoot on a tiled floor</p>
</div>

### Common Causes
<div class="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-6 rounded-r-xl mb-6 shadow-lg">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-orange-800 mb-3 flex items-center text-lg">
    <span class="text-2xl mr-3">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>
    Root Causes
  </h4>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Uneven substrate:</strong> A surface that isn't level or flat can lead to lippage</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Incorrect adhesive application:</strong> Too much or too little adhesive can cause tiles to sit at varying heights</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Using large-format tiles without leveling systems:</strong> Larger tiles are more prone to lippage if not set carefully</p>
</div>

### Fixing Lippage
<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 rounded-r-xl mb-6 shadow-lg">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3 flex items-center text-lg">
    <span class="text-2xl mr-3">üîß</span>
    During Installation
  </h4>
  <p>‚Ä¢ Use a tile leveling system (clips and wedges) to maintain even heights</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ Check for flatness after setting each tile and adjust before the adhesive cures</p>
</div>

<div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 rounded-r-xl mb-6 shadow-lg">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-green-800 mb-3 flex items-center text-lg">
    <span class="text-2xl mr-3">üõ†Ô∏è</span>
    After Installation
  </h4>
  <p>‚Ä¢ If lippage is minimal, it may be smoothed out with a rubbing stone</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ For severe cases, the affected tiles might need to be removed and reset with proper leveling techniques</p>
</div>

## Uneven Grout Lines

### Common Causes
<div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 rounded-r-xl mb-6 shadow-lg">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-3 flex items-center text-lg">
    <span class="text-2xl mr-3">üìê</span>
    Why Lines Become Uneven
  </h4>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Inconsistent spacer use:</strong> Not using spacers or mixing different spacer sizes leads to varying grout widths</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Uneven tile sizes:</strong> Some tiles may have slight variations in size, causing grout lines to appear irregular</p>
  <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Rushed application:</strong> Spreading grout unevenly or cleaning it too quickly can result in inconsistent joint appearance</p>
