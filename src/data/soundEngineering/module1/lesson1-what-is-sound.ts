## 1. Definition of Sound
Sound is a type of mechanical wave that results from the vibration of particles in a medium (such as air, water, or solids).

It is perceived by the human ear and interpreted by the brain as auditory information.

## 2. How Sound is Produced
Created when an object vibrates.

These vibrations disturb surrounding particles in the medium, causing compression and rarefaction (a pattern of high and low pressure).

The disturbance travels outward as a longitudinal wave.

## 3. Properties of Sound Waves

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Frequency (Hz) | Number of wave cycles per second; determines pitch. |
| Amplitude | Height of the wave; relates to volume (loudness). |
| Wavelength | Distance between two peaks of compression. |
| Speed | How fast the wave travels; depends on the medium. |
| Phase | Position of a point in time on a waveform cycle. |

## 4. Types of Sound Waves
**Audible Sound:** Frequencies between 20 Hz â€“ 20,000 Hz (heard by humans).

**Infrasound:** Below 20 Hz (e.g., earthquakes).

**Ultrasound:** Above 20,000 Hz (e.g., used in medical imaging).

## 5. Mediums for Sound Transmission
**Solids:** Sound travels fastest (particles are closely packed).

**Liquids:** Moderate speed.

**Gases (like air):** Sound travels slowest.

**Vacuum:** No sound transmission (no particles to vibrate).

## 6. Sound vs. Noise

| Sound | Noise |
|-------|-------|
| Organized vibrations | Disorganized, random vibrations |
| Pleasant or neutral | Often unwanted or disruptive |

## 7. Human Perception of Sound
**Pitch:** Perception of frequency.

**Loudness:** Perception of amplitude.

**Timbre:** Quality or color of sound; why the same note sounds different on a violin vs. a piano.

## 8. Measurement of Sound
**Decibel (dB):** Unit to measure sound intensity.

**Sound Level Meter:** Tool to measure environmental sound levels.

## 9. Applications of Sound
- Communication (speech, telecommunication)
- Entertainment (music, cinema)
- Navigation (sonar, echolocation)
- Medicine (ultrasound scanning)
- Engineering (acoustics, noise control)

## 10. Summary
Sound is a mechanical wave created by vibrations and transmitted through a medium.

Our perception of sound depends on its frequency, amplitude, and waveform.

Sound plays a crucial role in many aspects of life, from communication to science and technology.`
