<h3>ðŸŒ€ A. Frequency</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0CSDL5o-jk" title="Frequency" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<strong>Key Features: Pitch Determination</strong>
<p>Frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz), is the number of wave cycles per second, determining pitch (low for bass, high for treble). Human hearing ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.</p>
<p>Frequency is critical for tuning instruments or designing sound effects with specific pitches. Engineers must balance frequencies to create clear mixes. The course includes virtual exercises to adjust frequencies in DAWs, helping learners understand their impact on pitch. Online forums allow students to discuss frequency-related challenges, ensuring they can apply this knowledge effectively in music production, film sound, or other audio contexts.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”Š B. Amplitude</h3>

</div>
<strong>Key Features: Loudness Control</strong>
<p>Amplitude, measured in decibels (dB), is the waveâ€™s height, determining loudness. Higher amplitude means louder sound, critical for mixing and mastering.</p>
<p>Amplitude affects how audio is perceived in terms of volume, impacting listener comfort and mix balance. Engineers use amplitude adjustments to highlight vocals or instruments. The course offers practical exercises in DAWs to manipulate amplitude, with online feedback from instructors to refine techniques. This hands-on approach ensures learners can control loudness effectively, preparing them for professional audio production tasks.</p>

<h3>ðŸŒŠ C. Wavelength</h3>

</div>
<strong>Key Features: Medium-Dependent Travel</strong>
<p>The speed of sound varies by medium (343 m/s in air, 1,480 m/s in water, 5,960 m/s in steel), affecting timing in audio applications.</p>
<p>Soundâ€™s speed influences delay and echo in recordings, critical for live sound and studio work. The course includes simulations to demonstrate speed differences across mediums, helping learners design effective acoustic environments. Online discussion forums enable students to share insights on managing timing issues, ensuring they can apply this knowledge to create precise, high-quality audio in diverse settings.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”„ E. Phase</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtLIIfJ6IwQ" title="Phase" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<strong>Key Features: Wave Alignment and Interference</strong>
<p>Phase, measured in degrees, describes a waveâ€™s position in its cycle, critical for avoiding interference issues like sound cancellation in mixing.</p>
<p>Phase issues can degrade audio quality, especially in multi-microphone setups. Engineers must align phases to ensure clarity. The course offers DAW-based exercises to identify and correct phase problems, with online instructor feedback to guide learners. This practical training ensures students can manage phase effectively, producing clean and professional audio mixes.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”‰ F. Timbre</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjJLAcDb_MU" title="Timbre" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<strong>Key Features: Sound Quality and Character</strong>
<p>Timbre, or tone color, distinguishes sounds with the same pitch and loudness, shaped by harmonics and overtones (e.g., violin vs. flute).</p>
<p>Timbre defines the unique character of sounds, crucial for creating distinctive audio in music or film. The course provides audio samples and DAW exercises to manipulate timbre, helping learners craft unique soundscapes. Online forums foster discussions on timbreâ€™s creative applications, ensuring students can use it to enhance the emotional impact of their audio projects.</p>

<h2>3. Types of Sound Waves</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Anh9HthWgQ" title="Types of Sound Waves" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<strong>Key Features: Longitudinal, Transverse, Complex, Pure Tone</strong>
<p>Sound waves include longitudinal (sound in air), transverse (in strings), complex (real-world sounds), and pure tones (single frequency).</p>
<p>Understanding wave types helps engineers select appropriate recording techniques. For example, longitudinal waves are key for air-based audio, while complex waves dominate real-world sounds. The courseâ€™s interactive tutorials allow learners to analyze wave types in DAWs, with online feedback to refine their skills.
