## 1. Introduction to Mic Placement

**Definition**: Mic placement refers to the positioning and orientation of a microphone relative to a sound source to achieve the desired tonal quality, clarity, and isolation.

**Importance**: Affects tone, presence, noise level, and recording balance. Helps manage proximity effect, feedback, and room acoustics. Crucial in studio, live, and broadcast environments.

## 2. Key Factors Affecting Mic Placement

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Distance** | Affects loudness, proximity effect, room tone |
| **Angle (off-axis/on-axis)** | Changes tonal character and clarity |
| **Environment** | Room acoustics can add echo or reverb |
| **Mic type/pattern** | Directionality determines optimal position |
| **Sound source type** | Different instruments or voices need different setups |

## 3. General Guidelines for Mic Placement

- **On-Axis Placement**: Mic is pointed directly at the sound source. Brighter, clearer sound. Most sensitive to detail.
- **Off-Axis Placement**: Mic is angled slightly away from the source. Reduces harshness, captures more room sound. Helps control plosives and sibilance.
- **Close Miking**: 1â€“12 inches from source. Dry, detailed sound with low room reflection. Risks: proximity effect (bass boost), plosives.
- **Distant Miking**: 1 foot or more from source. Natural, ambient sound. Best in acoustically treated or well-behaved rooms.

## 4. Mic Placement for Voice (Podcasting, Vocals)

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Close Mic (6â€“12 inches)** | Clean, full voice; watch for plosives and sibilance |
| **Use of Pop Filter** | Prevents popping from "p" and "b" sounds |
| **Slight Off-Axis (15â€“30Â°)** | Reduces harshness and sibilance |
| **Distance Miking (1â€“2 feet)** | More natural voice, more room sound |
| **Tip**: Use cardioid or dynamic mics for vocal isolation in untreated rooms. | |

## 5. Mic Placement for Instruments

- **Acoustic Guitar**: 6â€“12 inches from the 12th fret, slightly off-axis. Avoid pointing directly at the sound hole (boomy). Combine mic on body + mic on neck for depth.
- **Drums**:
  - Kick drum: Inside shell (attack), outside front head (body)
  - Snare: Top close mic, angled toward center
  - Overheads: Spaced pair or XY over kit
  - Room mics: Add ambience and depth
- **Piano**:
  - Upright: Behind soundboard or over open lid
  - Grand: Multiple mics over soundboard strings
  - Blend close and room mics for full tone
- **Brass/Woodwinds**: Mic 6â€“12 inches from bell, slightly off-axis. Avoid placing directly in airflow.

## 6. Stereo Mic Techniques

| Technique | Description | Pattern | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **XY** | Two cardioids at 90Â°, capsules close | Coincident | Tight stereo image, phase-coherent |
| **AB** | Two omnis spaced apart | Time difference | Wide stereo, natural room |
| **ORTF** | Two cardioids at 110Â°, 17cm apart | Near-coincident | Balanced stereo with space |
| **Mid/Side (M/S)** | One cardioid + one figure-8 mic | Adjustable width | Flexible post-processing |

## 7. Mic Placement for Podcasting/Voiceovers

</div>

- **Home/Studio Recording**:
  - Dynamic mic (e.g., SM7B) close to mouth (~6 inches)
  - Pop filter + boom arm for stability
  - Cardioid pattern to minimize room noise
- **Multiple Hosts/Guests**:
  - Individual mics for each speaker
  - Avoid mic bleed: position off-axis and use directional mics

## 8. Common Mic Placement Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Mic too close to mouth | Plosives, boomy sound (proximity effect) |
| Mic too far from source | Room noise, lack of clarity |
| Directly in airflow path | Popping sounds from breath |
| Poor angle (on-axis sibilance) | Harsh "s" sounds, excessive treble |
| Incorrect mic type | Misbalanced tone or high noise floor |

## 9. Practical Tips

- Use headphones to monitor mic placement in real time
- Record short tests at different angles/distances
- Treat your room (even lightly) for better results
- Use shock mounts and isolation to reduce handling noise
- Label and document successful placements for future setups
