## Question 1
**What is the primary function of a microphone?**

A. To amplify sound directly  
B. To convert sound into light  
C. To convert sound into electrical signals  
D. To store sound digitally  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: A microphone is a transducer that converts acoustic energy (sound) into electrical signals for recording, amplification, or broadcasting.

---

## Question 2
**Which of the following is TRUE about dynamic microphones?**

A. They require phantom power to operate  
B. They are very sensitive and fragile  
C. They use a ribbon suspended in a magnetic field  
D. They are rugged and handle high sound pressure levels well  

**Answer**: D

**Explanation**: Dynamic microphones are rugged, durable, and can handle high sound pressure levels without requiring external power.

---

## Question 3
**Which microphone type uses a capacitor to detect sound?**

A. Dynamic  
B. Condenser  
C. Ribbon  
D. Lavalier  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Condenser microphones use a capacitor (electrostatic) element to detect sound and require phantom power (+48V) or battery power.

---

## Question 4
**What is one major drawback of ribbon microphones?**

A. They cannot capture low frequencies  
B. They require USB connectivity  
C. They are very delicate and sensitive to wind  
D. They are not used in professional studios  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Ribbon microphones are very delicate and sensitive to handling and wind, making them unsuitable for outdoor or rough handling situations.

## Question 5
**What type of pickup pattern captures sound equally from all directions?**

A. Cardioid  
B. Supercardioid  
C. Omnidirectional  
D. Bidirectional  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Omnidirectional microphones pick up sound equally from all directions (360Â°), making them ideal for capturing ambient sound and group conversations.

---

## Question 6
**What pickup pattern is shaped like a heart and rejects sound from the rear?**

A. Hypercardioid  
B. Omnidirectional  
C. Bidirectional  
D. Cardioid  

**Answer**: D

**Explanation**: Cardioid microphones have a heart-shaped pickup pattern that picks up sound primarily from the front and rejects sound from the rear.

---

## Question 7
**Which microphone is BEST suited for film and television production in noisy or distant environments?**

A. USB microphone  
B. Lavalier microphone  
C. Shotgun microphone  
D. Boundary microphone  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Shotgun microphones are highly directional with narrow pickup angles, making them ideal for isolating sound in noisy environments or capturing distant sources.

---

## Question 8
**Which microphone is typically clipped to clothing for hands-free voice capture?**

A. Shotgun  
B. Lavalier  
C. Ribbon  
D. Boundary  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Lavalier microphones are small, clip-on mics designed for hands-free voice capture, commonly used in film, broadcasting, and theater.

---

## Question 9
**What type of microphone has a figure-8 pickup pattern, capturing sound from the front and back but rejecting the sides?**

A. Cardioid  
B. Supercardioid  
C. Bidirectional  
D. Omnidirectional  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Bidirectional (figure-8) microphones pick up sound from the front and back while rejecting sound from the sides, making them ideal for interviews and stereo miking techniques.

---

## Question 10
**Which factor is NOT commonly considered when selecting a microphone?**

A. Source type  
B. Budget  
C. Color of the microphone  
D. Pickup pattern  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: The color of the microphone is not a functional consideration when selecting a microphone. Source type, budget, and pickup pattern are all important factors.

---

## Question 11
**What is the main advantage of close miking?**

A. It captures more room ambience  
B. It provides dry, detailed sound with low room reflection  
C. It reduces proximity effect  
D. It requires less gain from the preamp  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Close miking (1-12 inches from source) provides dry, detailed sound with low room reflection, though it can introduce proximity effect.

---

## Question 12
**Which stereo miking technique uses two cardioids at 90Â° with capsules close together?**

A. AB  
B. XY  
C. ORTF  
D. Mid/Side  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: XY technique uses two cardioid microphones positioned at 90Â° to each other with capsules close together for a tight stereo image.

---

## Question 13
**What is the primary purpose of a pop filter?**

A. To increase microphone sensitivity  
B. To prevent popping sounds from "p" and "b" sounds  
C. To reduce room noise  
D. To add reverb to the recording  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Pop filters prevent plosive sounds (popping from "p" and "b" sounds) from reaching the microphone diaphragm.

---

## Question 14
**Which mic placement technique is best for reducing sibilance?**

A. On-axis placement  
B. Slight off-axis placement (15-30Â°)  
C. Very close placement  
D. Distant placement  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Slight off-axis placement (15-30Â°) helps reduce harshness and sibilance by avoiding direct on-axis pickup of high-frequency sounds.

---

## Question 15
**What is the main disadvantage of distant miking?**

A. It requires more gain from the preamp  
B. It captures more room noise and ambience  
C. It increases proximity effect  
D. It reduces microphone sensitivity  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Distant miking (1 foot or more from source) captures more room noise and ambience, which may not be desirable in untreated or noisy environments.

## Scoring Guide

- **15-13 correct**: Excellent! You have a strong understanding of microphone types and placement techniques.
- **12-10 correct**: Good work! You understand most concepts but may need to review some areas.
- **9-7 correct**: Fair understanding. Consider reviewing the module content before proceeding.
- **6 or fewer correct**: Please review the module content thoroughly before taking the quiz again.

## Review Areas

If you struggled with certain questions, focus on reviewing:

- **Questions 1-5**: Basic microphone types and characteristics
