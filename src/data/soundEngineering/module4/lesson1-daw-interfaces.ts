## 1. What is a DAW?

A Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is a software application used to record, edit, mix, and produce audio.

**Key Functions:**
- Multitrack recording
- Audio editing (cut, copy, trim, fade)
- MIDI sequencing
- Mixing and mastering
- Plug-in support (EQ, compression, effects)

## 2. Purpose of a DAW Interface

The interface of a DAW refers to the visual layout and control system through which users interact with audio tracks and tools.

**Goals of a DAW Interface:**
- Make audio workflows efficient
- Provide visual feedback of waveforms, levels, automation
- Allow users to manipulate sound with precision

## 3. Common Components of a DAW Interface

- **Track View / Arrangement Window:** Timeline-based layout showing audio, MIDI, and automation tracks. Users can drag, cut, fade, duplicate, or loop clips.
- **Mixer / Mixing Console:** Visual representation of channel strips, volume faders, pan knobs, mute/solo buttons, plug-in insert slots, sends/returns for effects.
- **Transport Controls:** Play / Pause / Stop buttons, record button, loop/rewind/fast forward, shows playhead position (timecode).
- **MIDI Editor (Piano Roll):** Program and edit MIDI data, notes shown on grid with piano keyboard, edit velocity, note length, timing.
