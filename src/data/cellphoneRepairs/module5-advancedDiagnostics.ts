          ðŸ”¹ **8. Testing After Replacement**

          - Reassemble the device carefully
          - Power on and navigate to biometric settings
          - Set up fingerprint or face recognition anew
          - Verify sensor responsiveness and accuracy
          - Test multiple enrollments to confirm reliability

          ðŸ”¹ **9. Challenges and Limitations**

          - High security makes biometric repairs complex
          - Many parts are device-locked and non-transferable
          - Some repairs require official tools only accessible to authorized service providers
          - Software updates can affect biometric component compatibility

          ðŸ”¹ **10. Best Practices**

          - Always document device details (model, serial number) before repair
          - Advise customers about limitations and risks
          - Use genuine parts whenever possible
          - Keep repair environment ESD-safe and dust-free
          - Maintain updated knowledge on device-specific biometric technologies

          ðŸ”¹ **11. Summary**

          Replacing and programming biometric components demands precision, specialized tools, and adherence to security protocols. While Touch ID repairs can be done with caution, Face ID replacements typically require authorized equipment and software to maintain functionality. Proper repair ensures device security and user convenience remain intact.
