          "To keep your battery healthy, try not to let it go all the way to 0% or charge past 100% every time. Charging in short bursts is actually better for the phone in the long run."

          **ðŸ”¸ Port Cleaning Script**
          "Every few weeks, it's a good idea to clean out the charging port gently with a dry toothbrush or compressed air. Lint can collect there and cause charging problems."

          **ðŸ”¸ Accessories Script**
          "I recommend a tempered glass screen protector and a shockproof case. They absorb impact and prevent costly screen repairs in the future."

          ðŸ”¹ **5. Benefits of Customer Education**

          - Fewer repeat visits for preventable issues (saving both you and the customer time)
          - Stronger relationships built on trust and transparency
          - Word-of-mouth referrals from customers who feel cared for and informed
          - Upselling opportunities for accessories, maintenance plans, and training
          - Positioning yourself as a knowledgeable professional rather than just a technician

          ðŸ”¹ **6. Summary**

          Educating customers on routine maintenance and care is just as important as performing the repair itself. Simple changes in user behaviorâ€”such as better charging habits, proper cleaning, and regular updatesâ€”can extend a phone's lifespan significantly. As a technician, your role includes helping users understand how to avoid common problems and take responsibility for the health of their devices. This not only enhances the value of your service but also contributes to better customer retention and satisfaction.
