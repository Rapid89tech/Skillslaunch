### Check for Leaks

Inspect pipes, connections, and fixtures for drips or corrosion.

### Examine Water Pressure

Monitor for sudden changes indicating issues.

### Inspect Seals and Gaskets

Replace worn components to prevent leaks.

Regular inspections are the cornerstone of preventive maintenance. Checking for leaks in exposed pipes or fixtures identifies issues before they escalate, saving water and repair costs. Monitoring water pressure detects blockages or leaks early, while inspecting seals and gaskets prevents failures in faucets or valves. These proactive steps extend system lifespan, ensure compliance with regulations, and maintain efficient operation, making them essential for homeowners and professionals aiming to avoid emergency repairs.

### Keep Vents Clear

Ensure vent stacks are free of debris or nests.

### Flush Drains Periodically

Use baking soda and vinegar, followed by hot water.

### Clean Traps and Strainers

Remove and clean to prevent buildup and odors.

Maintaining drainage and venting systems prevents clogs and ensures proper airflow. Clearing vent stacks of debris like leaves or nests maintains pressure balance, preventing drainage issues. Flushing drains with natural cleaners like baking soda and vinegar reduces buildup without damaging pipes. Cleaning traps and strainers eliminates debris that causes odors or slow drainage. These practices promote smooth operation, reduce maintenance costs, and prevent backups, ensuring a healthy plumbing system.

### Prevent Freezing Pipes

Insulate pipes and allow a trickle of water during cold weather.

### Check Outdoor Fixtures

Remove hoses and shut off outdoor valves in fall.

### Inspect for Damage

Look for freezing or UV-related wear.

Winterizing protects plumbing systems from seasonal damage. Insulating pipes in unheated areas and allowing a trickle of water prevents freezing, which can cause bursts. Shutting off and draining outdoor fixtures like hoses or sprinklers avoids damage from ice expansion. Inspecting for wear from freezing or UV exposure ensures system integrity. These steps minimize winter-related repairs, protect pipes, and maintain functionality, making them critical for regions with cold climates.

### Flush Water Heaters

Drain to remove sediment and maintain efficiency.

### Inspect Washing Machine Hoses

Replace worn hoses every 3-5 years.

### Clean Dishwasher Filters

Rinse filters to ensure optimal performance.

Maintaining water heaters and appliances prevents inefficiencies and leaks. Flushing water heaters removes sediment, improving heating efficiency and extending tank life. Inspecting and replacing washing machine hoses prevents sudden failures, which can cause flooding. Cleaning dishwasher filters ensures proper drainage and performance, reducing repair needs. These maintenance tasks enhance appliance longevity, reduce energy costs, and prevent water damage, making them essential for comprehensive plumbing care.
