# Leak Detection and Prevention üîç

## Common Causes of Leaks

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/31dkwW5ofk8

* Loose or improperly sealed fittings.
* Cracked or worn-out washers and gaskets.
* Poorly soldered or cemented joints.
* Over-tightened connections causing pipe stress.

### Identifying Leak Sources: How to Fix a Leak Under Your Sink

Leaks undermine plumbing system integrity, often caused by poor sealing or material wear. This module explores common leak sources, using videos to illustrate issues like loose fittings and worn gaskets. Learners will study real-world scenarios to identify potential leak points. Understanding these causes equips students to address vulnerabilities during installation, reducing the risk of costly repairs in plumbing systems.

### Visual Inspection

* Check for water stains, drips, or puddles around connections.

### Pressure Testing

* Use a pressure gauge to detect drops indicating leaks.

### Leak Detection Dye or Sensors

* Add dye to system and check for colored water leaks.
* Use sensors to alert for water presence.

### Proactive Leak Identification: Leak Detection Techniques

Effective leak detection prevents damage and maintains system efficiency. This module covers visual inspections, pressure testing, and dye/sensor use through video tutorials and simulations. Learners will practice applying these methods to identify leaks in a test setup. Mastering detection techniques equips students to ensure system integrity, enabling early intervention and minimizing water loss in plumbing installations.

* Use plumber's tape or joint compound on threaded connections.
* Hand-tighten fittings before applying torque.
* Regularly inspect and replace seals, washers, and gaskets.
* Use high-quality materials and follow manufacturer guidelines.

### Leak-Free Systems: Preventing Plumbing Leaks

Preventing leaks enhances system longevity and reduces maintenance costs. This module covers sealing techniques, proper tightening, and material quality, using videos and virtual exercises. Learners will practice applying plumber's tape and inspecting seals to ensure durability. Understanding these measures equips students to install fixtures and appliances with robust, leak-resistant connections, supporting reliable plumbing performance across applications.
