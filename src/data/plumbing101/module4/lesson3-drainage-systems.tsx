# Drainage Systems: Sewer and Wastewater Management ðŸš½

## Basics of Drainage Systems

### Purpose

* Remove wastewater from sinks, showers, toilets, and appliances.
* Direct it to municipal sewer or septic system.

### Key Components

* Drain pipes: Carry water and waste from fixtures.
* Waste stacks: Vertical pipes transporting wastewater to main drain.
* Main sewer line: Connects to municipal sewer or septic tank.

### Effective Waste Removal: Introduction to Drainage Systems

Drainage systems efficiently remove wastewater, ensuring sanitation and system functionality. This module covers drain pipes, waste stacks, and sewer lines, explaining their roles in waste management. Through videos and simulations, learners will design a basic drainage system, ensuring proper slopes for gravity flow. Understanding these components prepares students to install and maintain drainage systems, preventing blockages and ensuring compliance with plumbing codes.

### Types of Wastewater

* Gray water: From sinks, showers, and laundry.
* Black water: From toilets and kitchen sinks.

### Wastewater Disposal Methods

* Municipal sewer systems: Treated at centralized facilities.
* Septic systems: On-site treatment via tanks and drain fields.

### Common Materials

* PVC, ABS, cast iron, and clay pipes.

### Code and Regulatory Requirements

* Proper slope (1/4 inch per foot).
* Approved materials and cleanouts for access.

### Sustainable Wastewater Handling: Stormwater Drainage Design

Sewer and wastewater management ensures safe disposal of gray and black water. This module explores municipal and septic systems, material choices like PVC, and code requirements for slopes and cleanouts. Learners will study disposal methods through case studies and virtual labs, designing compliant systems. Mastering these practices equips students to manage wastewater effectively, supporting environmental health and regulatory compliance in plumbing projects.
