# Water Supply Systems: Hot and Cold Water Distribution ðŸš°

## Components of a Water Supply System

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/YpZzM_naGD8

### Cold Water Supply

* Comes from municipal supply or private well.
* Includes main water line, shut-off valve, pressure-reducing valve, and distribution piping.

### Hot Water Supply

* Cold water feeds into a water heater (tank or tankless).
* Hot water lines carry heated water to fixtures like sinks and showers.

### Typical Materials Used

* Copper, PEX, CPVC, and galvanized steel.

### Reliable Water Delivery: Installing a Cold and Hot Water System

Water supply systems ensure consistent delivery of hot and cold water to fixtures. This module covers components like shut-off valves and water heaters, detailing their roles in maintaining flow and temperature. Through simulations and video tutorials, learners will design a basic supply system, selecting appropriate materials like PEX or copper. Understanding these components prepares students to install and troubleshoot water supply systems, ensuring efficiency and safety in residential and commercial settings.

### Cold Water Distribution

* Supplies water to all fixtures, appliances, and outdoor taps.
* Ensures consistent pressure and flow to meet demands.

### Hot Water Distribution

* Maintains proper temperature and pressure for user comfort.
* Includes recirculation lines in larger systems for instant hot water.

### Balancing Pressure and Flow

* Proper pipe sizing ensures steady pressure.
* Backflow prevention devices protect water quality.

### Efficient Distribution: Hot Water Recirculating Pump

Hot and cold water distribution systems are designed for reliability and user convenience. This module explores pipe sizing, recirculation lines, and backflow prevention to optimize flow and prevent contamination. Learners will practice designing distribution systems through virtual labs, guided by expert videos. Mastering these principles equips students to ensure consistent water delivery, reduce wastage, and maintain system integrity in diverse plumbing applications.
