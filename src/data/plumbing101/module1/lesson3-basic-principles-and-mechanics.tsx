### Water Supply Systems

* Deliver potable water from municipal sources, wells, or tanks to fixtures and appliances.
* Must maintain adequate pressure for consistent flow.

### Reliable Water Delivery: How Water Supply Systems Work

Water supply systems are the heart of plumbing, ensuring potable water reaches fixtures reliably. This module covers how municipal sources, wells, or tanks feed systems, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent pressure. Learners will use virtual simulations to design supply systems, exploring pipe sizing and pressure regulation. Through expert-led videos, students gain insights into real-world applications, preparing them to install and maintain systems that deliver clean water efficiently across various settings.

### Drainage and Waste Removal

* Gravity-based systems rely on downward slopes to remove wastewater efficiently.
* Includes venting systems to prevent blockages and ensure smooth drainage.

### Efficient Waste Management: Understanding Drainage Systems

Drainage systems use gravity and venting to remove wastewater effectively, preventing blockages and maintaining system integrity. This module explores the design of sloped pipes and venting mechanisms, using simulations to demonstrate their function. Learners will study real-world drainage challenges through video content, gaining skills to troubleshoot and maintain systems. This knowledge ensures students can design and manage drainage solutions that comply with codes and enhance building functionality.

### Cross-Connection Control

* Prevents contamination of potable water by separating supply lines from wastewater or non-potable sources.
* Incorporates backflow prevention devices, air gaps, and check valves.

### Contamination Prevention: Cross-Connection Control Explained

Cross-connection control is vital for protecting potable water from contamination. This module covers devices like backflow preventers and air gaps, explaining their role in separating supply and wastewater lines. Through interactive simulations and videos, learners will design systems that comply with safety standards. The course emphasizes the importance of these mechanisms in public health, equipping students with the skills to implement and maintain contamination-free systems in residential and commercial settings.

### Pressure and Flow

* Water pressure (measured in psi) drives water through pipes and fixtures.
* Proper pipe sizing and material selection ensure consistent flow and prevent pressure drops.

### Optimized Water Flow: Flow and Pressure in Pipes

Understanding water pressure and flow is essential for designing efficient plumbing systems. This module explores how pressure (measured in psi) drives water through pipes and how proper pipe sizing prevents flow disruptions. Learners will use virtual tools to simulate flow dynamics, gaining practical insights into system design. Video lectures highlight real-world applications, ensuring students can balance pressure and flow to avoid issues like leaks or low water supply, critical for effective plumbing.

### Friction Loss and Velocity

* Water moving through pipes encounters resistance, causing friction loss.
* Velocity (speed of water flow) must be balanced to avoid noisy pipes and system wear.

### Balancing Flow Dynamics: Friction Loss in Plumbing

Friction loss and water velocity are key factors in plumbing system performance. This module examines how resistance in pipes affects flow and how velocity must be controlled to prevent noise and wear. Through simulations and expert videos, learners will explore pipe sizing and material choices to optimize flow dynamics. The course equips students with the skills to design systems that minimize friction loss, ensuring durability and efficiency in residential and commercial plumbing projects.

### Hot and Cold Water Distribution

* Hot water systems include water heaters, recirculation loops, and insulation to maintain temperature.
* Cold water systems supply drinking water and feed fixtures like sinks, toilets, and outdoor taps.

### Temperature Regulation: Hot and Cold Water Systems

Hot and cold water distribution systems are critical for user comfort and system efficiency. This module covers water heaters, recirculation loops, and insulation for hot water, alongside cold water systems for drinking and fixtures. Learners will use simulations to design balanced systems, ensuring consistent temperatures and flow. Video content highlights practical applications, preparing students to install and maintain systems that meet occupant needs while optimizing energy use in diverse plumbing scenarios.

## Common Plumbing Materials and Components

### Piping Materials

* **Copper**: Durable, reliable, and resistant to corrosion.
* **PVC and CPVC**: Lightweight, affordable, and easy to install.
* **PEX**: Flexible, freeze-resistant, and commonly used in residential applications.

### Material Selection: PVC vs Copper vs PEX

Choosing the right piping material is crucial for plumbing system performance. This module compares copper, PVC, CPVC, and PEX, highlighting their durability, cost, and application suitability. Learners will explore material properties through videos and virtual labs, understanding how to select materials for specific projects. The course emphasizes practical considerations, such as corrosion resistance and ease of installation, preparing students to make informed choices for efficient and long-lasting plumbing systems.

### Fittings and Valves

* Elbows, tees, and couplings for directing water flow.
* Ball valves, gate valves, and check valves for controlling and regulating flow.

### Flow Control Components: Plumbing Fittings and Valves

Fittings and valves are essential for directing and controlling water flow in plumbing systems. This module covers elbows, tees, couplings, and various valves, explaining their roles in system functionality. Through simulations and video tutorials, learners will design systems using these components, ensuring efficient flow and pressure regulation. The course provides practical insights into selecting and installing fittings and valves, equipping students to build reliable systems that meet industry standards and project requirements.

### Fixtures and Appliances

* Sinks, faucets, showers, water heaters, and dishwashers as the end points of a plumbing system.

### End-Point Functionality: Plumbing Fixtures Overview

Fixtures and appliances, such as sinks, faucets, and water heaters, are the user-facing components of plumbing systems. This module explores their design, installation, and maintenance, emphasizing their role in delivering water and enhancing user experience. Learners will use virtual tools to simulate fixture installations, supported by expert videos showcasing real-world applications. The course prepares students to select and maintain fixtures that ensure functionality, efficiency, and user satisfaction in diverse plumbing projects.
