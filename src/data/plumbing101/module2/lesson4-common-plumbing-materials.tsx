### Purpose

* Prevent leaks and ensure tight connections.

### Types

* Rubber gaskets for flanges.
* O-rings for compression fittings.

### Applications

* Used in faucet connections, pipe joints, and valve assemblies.

### Leak-Proof Connections: O-Rings vs Gaskets

Seals and gaskets, such as rubber gaskets and O-rings, are critical for preventing leaks in plumbing systems. This module explores their applications in faucets, pipe joints, and valves, using video tutorials and simulations to demonstrate proper installation. Learners will practice selecting and installing seals, ensuring tight, reliable connections. Mastering these materials equips students to maintain system integrity, reducing maintenance costs and ensuring long-term performance in plumbing projects.

### Flux

* A paste or liquid applied before soldering copper pipes.
* Cleans and prepares the surface for a strong bond.

### Solder

* A metal alloy (usually lead-free) that melts to join copper pipes.

### How to Use

* Apply flux, heat the joint with a torch, and feed solder into the connection.

### Strong Copper Bonds: How to Solder Copper Pipes

Flux and solder are essential for creating durable, leak-free copper pipe connections. This module covers the soldering process, from applying flux to heating joints, through expert-led videos and virtual practice. Learners will master techniques for clean, strong bonds, ensuring system reliability in potable water and heating applications. Understanding soldering equips students to handle copper installations professionally, meeting industry standards for safety and performance.

### PVC Cement and Primer

* Solvent-based adhesives that chemically bond PVC pipes and fittings.
* Primer cleans and softens surfaces for a stronger bond.

### Epoxy and Sealants

* Used for repairing leaks, sealing threads, and filling small cracks.

### Silicone Caulk

* Creates a waterproof seal around fixtures and joints.

### Secure Bonding Solutions: How to Prime & Glue PVC Pipe

Adhesives like PVC cement, epoxy, and silicone caulk ensure strong, waterproof connections in plumbing systems. This module covers their applications, from bonding PVC pipes to sealing fixtures, through video demonstrations and simulations. Learners will practice applying primer and cement for PVC and using sealants for repairs, ensuring leak-free systems. Mastering these materials prepares students to handle diverse plumbing tasks, enhancing system durability and client satisfaction.
