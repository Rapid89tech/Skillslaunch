# Using Pipe Fittings, Valves, and Connectors ðŸ”§

## Common Pipe Fittings

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/yfr5Ob0ghNs

### Elbows

* Change pipe direction (e.g., 90Â° or 45Â°).

### Tees

* Split or combine flow in two directions.

### Couplings

* Join same-diameter pipes.

### Reducers

* Transition between different pipe sizes.

### Versatile Flow Control: Pipe Fittings Commonly Used in Piping

Pipe fittings like elbows, tees, couplings, and reducers direct and manage water flow in plumbing systems. This module covers their applications through video tutorials and simulations, helping learners design efficient layouts. Students will practice selecting and installing fittings for specific scenarios, ensuring system functionality. Mastering these components equips students to create adaptable, leak-free plumbing networks for diverse residential and commercial projects.

### Ball Valves

* Provide full on/off flow control; durable for various applications.

### Gate Valves

* Regulate or shut off flow; used for mainline isolation.

### Check Valves

* Allow one-directional flow to prevent backflow.

### Pressure-Reducing Valves

* Maintain consistent pressure to protect fixtures.

### Flow Regulation Mastery: Types of Plumbing Valves and Their Functions

Valves like ball, gate, check, and pressure-reducing types control water flow and protect systems. This module explores their functions and installation through videos and virtual labs, emphasizing proper selection for specific needs. Learners will practice installing valves, ensuring reliable flow control. Understanding valve applications equips students to design and maintain systems that meet safety and performance standards in plumbing projects.

### Threaded Adapters

* Convert between different thread types or sizes.

### Unions

* Allow easy disconnection for repairs.

### Flanges

* Provide bolted connections for high-pressure applications.

### Flexible System Connections: What Are Pipe Unions & Bushings

Connectors and adapters, such as threaded adapters, unions, and flanges, enhance system flexibility and maintenance. This module covers their roles in connecting diverse pipe types through video demonstrations and simulations. Learners will practice installing these components, ensuring secure, accessible connections. Mastering connectors equips students to build adaptable, maintainable plumbing systems, supporting efficient repairs and upgrades in various applications.
