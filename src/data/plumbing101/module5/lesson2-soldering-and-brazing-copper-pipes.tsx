### Cut the Pipe to Length

* Use a tubing cutter for clean, square cuts.

### Deburr the Edges

* Remove burrs with a reaming tool or file for smooth surfaces.

### Clean the Pipe and Fitting

* Use abrasive pads or wire brushes to clean pipe exterior and fitting interior.

### Proper Surface Preparation: Proper Copper Prep: Cut-Ream-Deburr

Preparing copper pipes and fittings is critical for strong soldering and brazing joints. This module covers cutting, deburring, and cleaning techniques using tubing cutters and abrasive pads, ensuring optimal bonding surfaces. Learners will practice these steps through virtual simulations and video tutorials, mastering preparation for leak-free joints. Understanding these processes equips students to achieve professional-grade connections in copper piping systems for potable water and heating applications.

### Apply Flux

* Brush a thin, even layer of flux to prevent oxidation and aid solder flow.

### Heat the Joint

* Use a propane or MAP gas torch to heat the fitting evenly until flux bubbles.

### Apply the Solder

* Touch solder to the joint; it should melt and flow into the fitting.

### Let It Cool

* Allow joint to cool naturally; wipe off excess flux.

### Effective Soldering Techniques: How to Solder Copper Pipe The CORRECT Way

Soldering creates durable, leak-free copper joints for water supply systems. This module details flux application, even heating, and solder flow, using videos and simulations to guide learners. Students will practice soldering, ensuring proper heat control to avoid overheating. Mastering soldering equips students to install reliable copper piping, meeting industry standards for residential and commercial plumbing projects, with a focus on precision and safety.

### When to Braze

* Used for higher-pressure systems or stronger joints with acetylene torches.

### Preparation and Technique

* Clean and flux as with soldering.
* Heat joint to a higher temperature until brazing rod melts and flows.
* Ensure complete alloy penetration for strength.

### High-Strength Brazing: How To Braze Copper Pipe Like A Pro

Brazing copper pipes creates robust joints for high-pressure applications like HVAC systems. This module covers preparation, high-temperature heating, and brazing rod application through video demonstrations and virtual practice. Learners will master techniques for deep alloy penetration, ensuring durable connections. Understanding brazing equips students to handle specialized plumbing tasks, enhancing system reliability in demanding industrial and commercial environments.
