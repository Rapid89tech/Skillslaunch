# Cutting, Threading, and Joining Pipes ðŸ”§

## Cutting Pipes

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/UmnYADLIREA

### Manual Tools

* **Hacksaw**: Effective for metal and plastic pipes but requires careful, even strokes.
* **Tubing Cutter**: Provides a cleaner, precise cut, ideal for copper pipes.

### Power Tools

* **Reciprocating Saw**: Ideal for cutting larger metal pipes.
* **Chop Saw or Miter Saw**: Ensures clean, square cuts on PVC and rigid materials with appropriate blades.

### Precision Cutting Techniques: How to Cut Plumbing Pipes and Tubing

Cutting pipes accurately is essential for creating reliable plumbing connections. This module explores manual tools like hacksaws and tubing cutters, as well as power tools like reciprocating and chop saws, to achieve clean cuts. Learners will practice cutting techniques through virtual simulations and video tutorials, ensuring square cuts for seamless fittings. Mastering these tools equips students to prepare pipes efficiently, minimizing errors and ensuring leak-free installations across various materials.

### Threading Machines

* Use a pipe threading machine to cut threads into metal pipe ends.
* Apply thread-cutting oil to reduce friction and create cleaner threads.

### Hand Threaders

* Suitable for smaller diameters or fieldwork.
* Secure pipe in a vise and rotate the die manually to form threads.

### Accurate Thread Creation: How To Use The RIDGIDÂ® 1224 Threading Machine

Threading pipes ensures secure connections for metal piping systems. This module covers threading machines and hand threaders, emphasizing the use of cutting oil for smooth, precise threads. Through videos and simulations, learners will practice threading techniques, ensuring compatibility with fittings. Understanding these methods prepares students to create durable threaded joints, essential for high-pressure systems in residential and commercial plumbing projects.

### Threaded Joints

* Apply Teflon tape or pipe joint compound for a tight seal.
* Hand-tighten, then use a wrench for 1â€“2 additional rotations.

### Compression Fittings

* Insert pipe into fitting, then tighten compression nut for a watertight seal.

### Push-to-Connect (Quick-Connect) Fittings

* Push pipe into fitting until it clicks; no tools or sealing materials needed.

### Secure Pipe Connections: Compression Fittings: 5 Ways to Avoid Leaks

Joining pipes effectively prevents leaks and ensures system integrity. This module explores threaded joints, compression fittings, and push-to-connect fittings, detailing their applications through video demonstrations and virtual labs. Learners will practice assembling each type, mastering sealing techniques like Teflon tape application. Understanding these methods equips students to create reliable, leak-free connections, enhancing system performance in diverse plumbing installations.
