### Cutting PVC

* Use a fine-tooth saw, PVC cutter, or power tool with a suitable blade.
* Deburr and chamfer cut ends for smooth fit.

### Priming and Cementing

* Apply PVC primer to clean and soften surfaces.
* Spread PVC cement on both pipe and fitting, then join with a quarter turn.
* Hold for a few seconds to set.

### Drying Time

* Allow 24 hours for curing before pressurizing.

### Efficient PVC Bonding: How To Cut, Prime & Cement PVC Pipe

PVC piping is widely used for drainage due to its affordability and ease of installation. This module covers cutting, priming, and cementing techniques, ensuring strong, leak-free joints through videos and simulations. Learners will practice assembling PVC systems, focusing on proper cement application and curing times. Mastering PVC installation equips students to create cost-effective, durable drainage systems, meeting code requirements for residential and commercial applications.

### Cutting PEX

* Use a PEX cutter for clean, square cuts.

### Connecting PEX Fittings

* **Crimp Connections**: Slide crimp ring, insert fitting, and compress with crimping tool; verify with gauge.
* **Expansion Connections**: Expand pipe end, insert fitting, and let it contract.
* **Push-Fit Connections**: Insert pipe into fitting until seated.

### Advantages of PEX

* Flexible, freeze-resistant, and requires fewer fittings.

### Flexible PEX Installation: PEX Pipe Installation Tips for Beginners

PEX piping's flexibility and ease of installation make it ideal for residential water supply systems. This module explores crimp, expansion, and push-fit connections, using videos and virtual labs to demonstrate techniques. Learners will practice installing PEX fittings, ensuring secure, leak-free connections. Understanding PEX's advantages equips students to implement efficient, durable systems, reducing installation time and enhancing reliability in modern plumbing projects.
