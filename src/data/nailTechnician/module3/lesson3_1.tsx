      <h3>âœ… Learning Objectives:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the basics of acrylic nail products and their chemical composition</li>
        <li>Learn how to properly prepare the natural nail for acrylic application</li>
        <li>Master sculpting techniques, including using tips, overlays, and fills</li>
        <li>Achieve a smooth, natural-looking finish through proper shaping and polishing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Introduction to Acrylic Nail Products</h3>

      <h4>Understanding Acrylic Chemistry</h4>
      <p><strong>Composition:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liquid monomer:</strong> The liquid component that combines with powder</li>
        <li><strong>Polymer powder:</strong> A finely milled powder that reacts with the liquid to form a durable, hard surface</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The Chemical Reaction (Polymerization):</strong></p>
      <p>When liquid monomer and polymer powder are combined, they form a paste that hardens into a strong material. Curing occurs as the chemical bonds form and strengthen, typically without the need for a UV or LED lamp.</p>

      <p><strong>Acrylic vs. Other Enhancements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acrylic is known for its strength and durability compared to gel or dip powder</li>
        <li>It is versatile and can be used for sculpting, extending, or reinforcing natural nails</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Product Types and Tools</h4>
      <p><strong>Acrylic Liquids:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular monomer vs. odorless monomer</li>
        <li>Selecting the right liquid for desired set time and working conditions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Acrylic Powders:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear, pink, white, and colored powders for different styles</li>
        <li>Specialty powders, such as glitter or color-changing options</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Essential Tools:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acrylic brush (usually Kolinsky or sable hair)</li>
        <li>Dappen dish for holding monomer</li>
        <li>Nail forms and tips for extension work</li>
        <li>Electric file and hand file for shaping</li>
        <li>Buffer and top coat for finishing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Preparing the Natural Nail for Acrylic Application</h3>

      <h4>Nail Preparation Steps</h4>

      <h5>1. Sanitize and Clean</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash hands and sanitize both client's and technician's hands</li>
        <li>Remove any old nail polish or gel</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>2. Push Back and Trim Cuticles</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a cuticle pusher and nippers to ensure the nail plate is clean and free of debris</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>3. Buff and Shape the Natural Nail</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightly buff the nail plate to remove shine, creating a surface the acrylic can adhere to</li>
        <li>Shape the natural nail edge to align with the desired enhancement shape</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>4. Dehydrate the Nail Plate</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Apply a nail dehydrator to remove oils and moisture</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>5. Apply a Primer</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Use acid-based or acid-free primer to promote adhesion</li>
        <li>Allow primer to dry slightly before applying acrylic</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Common Issues in Nail Preparation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Improper cuticle care leading to lifting</li>
        <li>Over-buffing, which can thin the natural nail and cause sensitivity</li>
        <li>Insufficient primer application, resulting in poor adhesion</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Sculpting Techniques</h3>

      <h4>Using Nail Tips and Overlays</h4>
      <p><strong>Nail Tips:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a tip size that fits the natural nail without overlapping the sidewalls</li>
        <li>Adhere the tip with nail adhesive, then trim and shape as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Overlays:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applying acrylic directly over the natural nail for strength and durability</li>
        <li>Ideal for clients who want reinforcement without added length</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Freehand Sculpting with Nail Forms</h4>
      <p><strong>Placing Forms:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Position forms snugly under the natural nail edge</li>
        <li>Ensure proper alignment to avoid crooked extensions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Building Extensions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create the desired length by placing the acrylic bead at the free edge and shaping it onto the form</li>
        <li>Use the body of the brush to smooth and taper the acrylic</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Fills and Maintenance</h4>
      <p><strong>When to Perform Fills:</strong></p>
      <p>Every 2â€“3 weeks as the natural nail grows out</p>

      <p><strong>Filling Process:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>File down the existing acrylic to remove lifted areas</li>
        <li>Reapply primer in exposed areas</li>
        <li>Add fresh acrylic to blend the regrowth with the existing enhancement</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Shaping and Finishing for a Smooth, Natural Look</h3>

      <h4>Shaping the Nail</h4>
      <p><strong>Initial Shaping:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a coarse file to create the basic shape (square, oval, almond, stiletto)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Refining the Shape:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a medium-grit file to smooth out edges</li>
        <li>Check from different angles to ensure symmetry</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Smoothing and Buffing</h4>
      <p><strong>File the Surface:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a finer-grit file or electric file to smooth bumps and ridges</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Buffing:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buff the entire nail surface to remove scratches</li>
        <li>Progress to a high-shine buffer if a polished look is desired without polish</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Final Finishing Steps</h4>
      <p><strong>Top Coat Application:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apply a high-gloss or matte top coat to seal and protect the acrylic</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Cleaning and Cuticle Oil:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean around the nail edges and apply cuticle oil for a finished, professional look</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Professional Tips</h3>

      <h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Over-buffing the natural nail</li>
        <li>Applying acrylic too close to the cuticle</li>
        <li>Using incorrect liquid-to-powder ratios</li>
        <li>Rushing the application process</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Quality Control:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for air bubbles and smooth application</li>
        <li>Ensure proper shaping and symmetry</li>
        <li>Verify client comfort and satisfaction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>âœ… Key Takeaways</h3>

      <p>Acrylic nails require understanding of chemical composition, proper nail preparation, mastery of sculpting techniques, and attention to finishing details. The combination of technical skill and artistic ability creates beautiful, durable nail enhancements that clients love.</p>

      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Practice makes perfect - continue refining your acrylic techniques through consistent application and learning!</p>
