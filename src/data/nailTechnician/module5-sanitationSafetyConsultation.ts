## Section 2: Proper Sterilization and Disinfection Protocols (1 hour)

### A. Levels of Cleanliness:

#### Sanitization:
- The removal of visible debris and reduction of bacteria on surfaces
- Example: Using soap and water to clean tools

#### Disinfection:
- The use of chemical agents to kill most bacteria and viruses on non-porous surfaces
- Example: Wiping workstations and tools with hospital-grade disinfectants

#### Sterilization:
- The complete elimination of all forms of microbial life, including spores
- Example: Using an autoclave to sterilize metal implements

### B. Cleaning Tools and Surfaces:

#### Tools:
- Pre-clean tools by removing visible dirt and residue
- Soak metal tools in an EPA-registered disinfectant for the manufacturer's recommended time
- Rinse and dry tools before using or storing
- Consider using an autoclave for high-risk tools to ensure full sterilization

#### Surfaces:
- Disinfect tables, chairs, UV/LED lamps, and armrests between clients
- Mop floors and clean frequently touched areas, such as door handles and light switches, regularly
- Use disposable covers or protective barriers on high-contact surfaces

### C. Storage and Maintenance:
- Keep cleaned tools in a covered container, clearly labeled
- Replace single-use items such as files and buffers after each client
- Ensure disinfectants are fresh and stored according to the manufacturer's instructions

## Section 3: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Proper Ventilation (1 hour)

### A. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):

#### Gloves:
- Protect hands from direct contact with clients' nails and potentially infectious materials
- Use nitrile or latex gloves for comfort and flexibility

#### Face Masks and Respirators:
- Masks can filter out fine dust and reduce inhalation of harmful fumes
- Respirators provide extra protection when working with strong chemicals
- Replace masks regularly and ensure respirators are properly fitted

#### Safety Goggles:
- Shield eyes from chemical splashes, dust, and small debris

### B. Proper Ventilation and Air Quality Control:

#### Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV):
- Install vents or fume extractors near workstations
- Directly capture and remove fumes and dust at the source

#### Air Filtration Systems:
- Use HEPA filters to trap airborne particles and ensure clean, breathable air
- Maintain and replace filters regularly

#### Room Layout and Airflow:
- Arrange workstations to allow fresh air circulation
- Open windows or doors (if possible) to improve ventilation

### C. Best Practices for Handling Chemicals Safely:
- Always read and follow the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each product
- Keep chemical containers tightly sealed when not in use
- Store products in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight or heat sources
- Mix and use products according to manufacturer guidelines to avoid dangerous reactions

## Key Takeaways
- A clean and safe environment protects both clients and technicians
- Proper sterilization and disinfection prevent the spread of pathogens
- PPE and adequate ventilation reduce exposure to chemicals and other hazards`
