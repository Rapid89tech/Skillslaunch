## Section 2: Gradient and Ombre Effects (1.5 hours)

### A. Using Sponges for Gradients

#### Tools and Products:
- Cosmetic sponges, makeup wedges, or specialized nail art sponges
- At least two complementary polish colors

#### Techniques:

**Simple Gradient:**
- Apply a base coat and let it dry
- Paint two or more colors side by side on a sponge, slightly overlapping
- Dab the sponge onto the nail in light, even motions
- Repeat until the desired intensity is achieved

**Advanced Gradient:**
- Blend three or more colors on the sponge for a multi-tonal effect
- Use a clean edge of the sponge to blend edges seamlessly

#### Common Mistakes and Fixes:
- If the gradient is patchy, apply a second layer once the first is dry
- Clean up edges with a small brush dipped in polish remover

### B. Using Brushes for Ombre Effects

#### Tools and Products:
- Flat or fan brushes
- Polishes or gel paints in gradient shades

#### Techniques:

**Horizontal Ombre:**
- Apply the base color
- Using a fan brush, gently blend a second color from the tip of the nail toward the center
- Layer and blend until a smooth transition is achieved

**Vertical Ombre:**
- Start at one side of the nail with a darker color and gradually blend it into a lighter shade on the other side
- Clean the brush often to avoid muddying colors

#### Best Practices:
- Work with slightly tacky polish to ensure smooth blending
- Seal each layer with a clear top coat before adding another gradient

### A. Importance of a Top Coat:

#### Protects the Design:
- Prevents chips and scratches
- Extends the longevity of the design

#### Enhances the Look:
- Adds shine for a polished appearance
- Can create a matte effect if a matte top coat is used

### B. Applying a Top Coat for a Professional Finish:

#### Technique:
- Use a steady hand and apply a thin, even layer
- Cover the entire nail, including the free edge, to seal the design completely

#### Best Practices:
- Let the nail art dry fully before applying the top coat
- Use a quick-dry top coat for convenience
- Apply a second top coat for extra durability
