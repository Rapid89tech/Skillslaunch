      <h5>Key Points:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Located beneath the cuticle</li>
        <li>Produces keratin cells for nail growth</li>
        <li>Damage can cause permanent nail deformities</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Nail Bed</h4>
      <p>The <strong>nail bed</strong> is the skin beneath the nail plate that supplies nutrients and support for nail growth.</p>

      <h5>Characteristics:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Smooth and uniform in healthy nails</li>
        <li>Provides essential nutrients</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Nail Plate</h4>
      <p>The <strong>nail plate</strong> is the hard, visible portion of the nail made of tightly packed keratin cells.</p>

      <h5>Functions:</h5>

        <li>Proper maintenance prevents hangnails</li>
        <li>Keeps nail matrix healthy</li>
        <li>Regular moisturizing essential</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Lunula</h4>
      <p>The <strong>lunula</strong> is the whitish, crescent-shaped area at the base of the nail plate, representing the visible part of the matrix.</p>

      <h5>Significance:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Indicator of overall nail health</li>
        <li>Varies in visibility between individuals</li>
