# Anatomy of the Nail and Nail Conditions

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the basic structure of the nail and its key components
- Identify common nail disorders and diseases
- Learn to recognize when a client's condition requires medical attention

## üî¨ Structure of the Nail

### Matrix
The **matrix** is the part of the nail located beneath the cuticle and is responsible for producing the keratin cells that form the nail plate.

**Key Points:**
- Located beneath the cuticle
- Produces keratin cells for nail growth
- Damage can cause permanent nail deformities

### Nail Bed
The **nail bed** is the skin beneath the nail plate that supplies nutrients and support for nail growth.

**Characteristics:**
- Smooth and uniform in healthy nails
- Provides essential nutrients
- Acts as foundation for nail plate

### Nail Plate
The **nail plate** is the hard, visible portion of the nail made of tightly packed keratin cells.

**Functions:**
- Protects fingertips
- Provides durable surface
- Main area for nail services

### Cuticle
The **cuticle** is the thin layer of skin that covers the base of the nail, acting as a protective barrier against infection.

**Care Tips:**
- Proper maintenance prevents hangnails
- Keeps nail matrix healthy
- Regular moisturizing essential

### Lunula
The **lunula** is the whitish, crescent-shaped area at the base of the nail plate, representing the visible part of the matrix.

**Significance:**
- Indicator of overall nail health
- Varies in visibility between individuals
- Should be protected during services

## ü©∫ Common Nail Disorders

### Brittle Nails (Onychorrhexis)
**Causes:** Dehydration, frequent exposure to water or chemicals
**Signs:** Splitting, peeling, or easily breakable nails
**Prevention:** Proper hydration, protective gloves, nail strengtheners

### Beau's Lines
**Description:** Horizontal depressions across the nail plate
**Causes:** Trauma, severe illness, nutritional deficiencies
**Treatment:** Address underlying cause

### Hangnails
**Description:** Small, torn pieces of skin near the cuticle
**Causes:** Dry skin, improper cuticle care
**Prevention:** Regular moisturizing and careful trimming

## ü¶† Nail Diseases

### Fungal Infections (Onychomycosis)
**Signs:** Thickened, discolored, or crumbly nails
**Risk Factors:** Moist environments, closed-toe shoes, weakened immune systems
**Treatment:** Antifungal treatments, medical referral if severe

### Bacterial Infections (Paronychia)
**Description:** Infection of tissue around the nail
**Signs:** Redness, swelling, and pain near nail fold
**Prevention:** Keep nails and cuticles clean, avoid picking hangnails

### Psoriasis of the Nails
**Signs:** Pitting, discoloration, thickening, or nail plate detachment
**Connection:** Often associated with skin psoriasis
**Management:** Coordination with dermatologist required

## ‚öïÔ∏è When to Refer Clients to Medical Professionals

### Always Refer When You See:
- Fungal infections not improving with basic care
- Signs of bacterial infection (pus, redness, extreme pain)
- Unusual changes in nail shape, color, or texture
- Persistent nail detachment or deep ridges
- Chronic inflammation

### How to Communicate Referrals:
- Be polite and professional
- Avoid making diagnoses
- Explain why medical advice is recommended
- Provide contact information for specialists
- Follow up after client sees professional

## üéØ Key Takeaways

Understanding nail anatomy and recognizing disorders is fundamental to providing safe, professional nail services. Always prioritize client health and safety by knowing when to refer to medical professionals.

**Remember:** When in doubt, refer it out!
