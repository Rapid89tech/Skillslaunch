      </ul>

      <h3>‚úÖ Section 2: Proper Sterilization and Disinfection Protocols (1 hour)</h3>

      <h4>A. Levels of Cleanliness:</h4>

      <h5>Sanitization:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The removal of visible debris and reduction of bacteria on surfaces</li>
        <li>Example: Using soap and water to clean tools</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Disinfection:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The use of chemical agents to kill most bacteria and viruses on non-porous surfaces</li>
        <li>Example: Wiping workstations and tools with hospital-grade disinfectants</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Sterilization:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The complete elimination of all forms of microbial life, including spores</li>
        <li>Example: Using an autoclave to sterilize metal implements</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>B. Cleaning Tools and Surfaces:</h4>

      <h5>Tools:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-clean tools by removing visible dirt and residue</li>
        <li>Soak metal tools in an EPA-registered disinfectant for the manufacturer's recommended time</li>
        <li>Rinse and dry tools before using or storing</li>
        <li>Consider using an autoclave for high-risk tools to ensure full sterilization</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Surfaces:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Disinfect tables, chairs, UV/LED lamps, and armrests between clients</li>
        <li>Mop floors and clean frequently touched areas, such as door handles and light switches, regularly</li>
        <li>Use disposable covers or protective barriers on high-contact surfaces</li>
      </ul>
