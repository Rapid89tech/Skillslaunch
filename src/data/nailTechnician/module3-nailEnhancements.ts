# Acrylic Nails

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the basics of acrylic nail products and their chemical composition
- Learn how to properly prepare the natural nail for acrylic application
- Master sculpting techniques, including using tips, overlays, and fills
- Achieve a smooth, natural-looking finish through proper shaping and polishing

## 🧪 Introduction to Acrylic Nail Products

### Understanding Acrylic Chemistry

**Composition:**
- **Liquid monomer:** The liquid component that combines with powder
- **Polymer powder:** A finely milled powder that reacts with the liquid to form a durable, hard surface

**The Chemical Reaction (Polymerization):**
When liquid monomer and polymer powder are combined, they form a paste that hardens into a strong material. Curing occurs as the chemical bonds form and strengthen, typically without the need for a UV or LED lamp.

**Acrylic vs. Other Enhancements:**
- Acrylic is known for its strength and durability compared to gel or dip powder
- It is versatile and can be used for sculpting, extending, or reinforcing natural nails

### Product Types and Tools

**Acrylic Liquids:**
- Regular monomer vs. odorless monomer
- Selecting the right liquid for desired set time and working conditions

**Acrylic Powders:**
- Clear, pink, white, and colored powders for different styles
- Specialty powders, such as glitter or color-changing options

**Essential Tools:**
- Acrylic brush (usually Kolinsky or sable hair)
- Dappen dish for holding monomer
- Nail forms and tips for extension work
- Electric file and hand file for shaping
- Buffer and top coat for finishing

## 🔧 Preparing the Natural Nail for Acrylic Application

### Nail Preparation Steps

#### 1. Sanitize and Clean
- Wash hands and sanitize both client's and technician's hands
- Remove any old nail polish or gel

#### 2. Push Back and Trim Cuticles
- Use a cuticle pusher and nippers to ensure the nail plate is clean and free of debris

#### 3. Buff and Shape the Natural Nail
- Lightly buff the nail plate to remove shine, creating a surface the acrylic can adhere to
- Shape the natural nail edge to align with the desired enhancement shape

#### 4. Dehydrate the Nail Plate

**Refining the Shape:**
- Use a medium-grit file to smooth out edges
- Check from different angles to ensure symmetry

### Smoothing and Buffing

**File the Surface:**
- Use a finer-grit file or electric file to smooth bumps and ridges

**Buffing:**
- Buff the entire nail surface to remove scratches
- Progress to a high-shine buffer if a polished look is desired without polish

### Final Finishing Steps

**Top Coat Application:**
- Apply a high-gloss or matte top coat to seal and protect the acrylic

**Cleaning and Cuticle Oil:**
- Clean around the nail edges and apply cuticle oil for a finished, professional look

## 💡 Professional Tips

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Over-buffing the natural nail
- Applying acrylic too close to the cuticle
- Using incorrect liquid-to-powder ratios
- Rushing the application process

### Quality Control:
- Check for air bubbles and smooth application
- Ensure proper shaping and symmetry
