# Guest Research and Outreach

üïµÔ∏è **Steps in Guest Research**:

1. **Check Their Online Presence**: Review LinkedIn, Twitter, or YouTube for background and style. Managers ensure guests align with the podcast's tone and audience expectations.

2. **Listen to Their Previous Interviews**: Gauge communication style and avoid repetitive questions. Managers note passions to tailor discussions, enhancing engagement.

3. **Read Their Work**: Books or blogs provide insights for unique angles. Managers pull quotes to enrich interviews, ensuring relevance to listeners.

4. **Find a Unique Angle**: Identify recent changes or unique opinions. Managers craft questions that align with audience interests, making episodes stand out.

5. **Create a Guest Profile**: Include bio, expertise, achievements, and social handles. Managers use Notion to organize profiles, streamlining preparation.
