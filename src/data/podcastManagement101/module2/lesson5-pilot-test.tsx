## Evaluate

ðŸŽ¯ **Audio quality**: High-quality audio is critical for listener retention. Managers use tools like Audacity to check clarity, ensuring professional sound that meets platform standards and enhances the listening experience.

ðŸŽ¯ **Engagement level**: Pilots gauge listener interest through pacing and content. Managers assess engagement via test audiences, refining elements like storytelling or CTAs to boost retention and interaction on social platforms.

ðŸŽ¯ **Audience feedback**: Feedback from friends or focus groups identifies strengths and weaknesses. Managers collect input via surveys or social media, using insights to tweak content, ensuring alignment with listener preferences before launch.
