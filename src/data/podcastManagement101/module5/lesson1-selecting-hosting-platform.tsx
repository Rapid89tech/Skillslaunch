      keyFeatures: 'File storage, RSS feed generation, analytics, distribution tools, monetization options',
      textContent: `A podcast hosting platform stores your audio files (e.g., MP3s recorded with a Rode PodMic) and delivers them to directories like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube Music via an RSS feed. **File storage** supports episode uploads (unlimited or tiered, e.g., 250MB–12 hours/month). **RSS feed generation** automates distribution, ensuring seamless updates when new episodes are published. **Analytics** provide insights into downloads, listener demographics (age, gender, location), and retention, critical for refining content and pitching sponsors. **Distribution tools** enable one-click submissions to major platforms, maximizing reach. **Monetization options** include dynamic ads, subscriptions, or listener donations. For example, hosting a Riverside.fm-recorded episode on Buzzsprout ensures reliable delivery and tracks listener locations. Unlike free platforms like SoundCloud, dedicated hosts offer professional tools, including IAB-certified stats for sponsors, SEO features for discoverability, and content ownership, making them essential for hobbyists launching solo shows or professionals scaling networks for global audiences.`

      keyFeatures: 'Goal alignment, analytics depth, ease of use, storage/bandwidth limits, RSS feed control, free trials, distribution integrations',
      textContent: `To select the best host, align features with your goals: hobbyist or commercial? Immediate monetization or future growth? Evaluate **analytics depth** (e.g., Podbean's granular metrics vs. Anchor's basic stats) to track audience behavior and pitch sponsors. Prioritize **ease of use** (e.g., Buzzsprout's drag-and-drop UI) for seamless uploading and scheduling, especially for beginners. Check **storage/bandwidth limits**—Anchor offers unlimited, while Buzzsprout caps free plans at 2 hours/month. Ensure **RSS feed control** to avoid platform lock-in and retain episode rights, critical for switching hosts. Test **free trials** (e.g., Captivate's 7-day trial) to assess workflows like uploading and analytics. Confirm **distribution integrations** for one-click submissions to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube Music. For example, a narrative podcast on Captivate leverages **marketing tools** like email opt-ins, while a hobbyist chooses Anchor for **cost-free hosting**. Verify **support quality** via live chat or forums (Buzzsprout excels) and check user reviews on X or Reddit for reliability. These steps ensure your host supports your current workflow and future scalability.`

      keyFeatures: 'Storage plans, migration ease, directory integrations, cost transparency, support reliability, monetization support, episode archiving',
      textContent: `Before committing to a host, ask these critical questions to ensure a long-term fit:

* **Does it offer unlimited storage or tiered plans?** Unlimited storage (e.g., Anchor, Podbean) suits high-output shows; tiered plans (e.g., Buzzsprout's 2–12 hours/month) fit budget-conscious creators.  
* **Can I migrate my podcast if I switch hosts?** Confirm easy RSS feed redirection to preserve subscribers (e.g., Transistor's seamless migration tools).  
* **Does it integrate with major directories?** Ensure one-click submissions to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music for broad reach.  
* **Are there hidden fees for analytics or distribution?** Verify pricing transparency, as some hosts (e.g., Libsyn) charge for advanced stats or ad tools.  
* **Is customer support reliable?** Look for 24/7 live chat, email, or community forums (e.g., Buzzsprout's responsive support, Captivate's tutorials).  
* **Does it support monetization?** Check for ad marketplaces, subscription tools, or donation integrations (e.g., Podbean's Patreon-like crowdfunding).  
* **Are there limits on episode uploads or archiving?** Confirm policies, as some hosts (e.g., Buzzsprout's free plan) auto-delete episodes after 90 days, impacting archives.  
  For example, a Riverside.fm podcast should verify migration ease to avoid losing Apple Podcasts subscribers. These questions ensure the host aligns with your budget, workflow, and growth plans, preventing costly switches or data loss.`
