## Zoom

**Key Features: Easy to use, widely popular**
**Notes: Lower audio quality**

Zoom is a familiar video conferencing tool, widely used for remote podcast interviews due to its simplicity and accessibility. Available on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, it allows quick setup with a free tier supporting up to 40-minute calls. Guests join via a link, making it ideal for less tech-savvy participants. However, Zoom compresses audio, resulting in lower quality (M4A files) compared to dedicated podcasting platforms, which can affect professional output. Recording locally on each participant's device using software like Audacity can improve quality, but this requires technical coordination. Zoom's video features aid rapport-building, but its audio limitations make it less ideal for studio-quality podcasts unless paired with local recording. It's best for beginners or those prioritizing ease over audio fidelity.

## Riverside.fm

**Key Features: Local HD recording, video + audio, stable**
**Notes: Video and audio, stable**

Riverside.fm is a leading platform for remote podcasting, offering local recording of uncompressed 48kHz WAV audio and up to 4K video for each participant. Available on Chrome/Edge browsers and iOS/Android apps, it supports up to eight participants (one host, seven guests), ideal for interviews or panels. Its progressive upload feature ensures files are saved to the cloud during recording, reducing data loss risks. Riverside includes AI-powered editing tools, transcription, and live streaming integrations (e.g., YouTube, Twitch). Pricing starts at $15/month for audio-only, with higher tiers for video and streaming. While user-friendly, it may require tech-savvy guests to ensure proper setup. Riverside's focus on high-quality local recording makes it a top choice for professional podcasters prioritizing audio and video excellence.

## Zencastr

**Key Features: Records separate tracks, free tier available**
**Notes: Free tier available**

Zencastr is a robust platform for remote podcast recording, known for local audio and video recording in browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave). Its free tier offers 8 hours/month of MP3 recording for two guests, while the $20/month Professional plan provides unlimited guests, WAV files, and video recording. Zencastr records separate tracks for each participant, simplifying post-production editing. Features include automatic transcription, a soundboard for intros/outros, and Dropbox integration for backups. Guests join via a link, requiring no downloads, though mobile support is limited. Zencastr's high-quality audio (16-bit 44.1kHz WAV) and reliability make it suitable for both beginners and pros. Its dark mode interface and AI clip highlights enhance usability, though video editing is basic compared to Riverside.

## SquadCast

**Key Features: Studio-quality audio, good for pros**
**Notes: Good for pros**

SquadCast is a professional-grade platform designed for high-quality remote podcast recording, supporting up to 10 participants (1 host, 9 guests). It records locally in WAV format, ensuring studio-quality audio (44.1kHz, 16-bit) with patented Drift Normalization to prevent sync issues. Available on Chrome, Firefox, and Android, it offers a user-friendly interface with a "green room" for pre-recording checks. Pricing starts at $20/month for 5 hours, with higher tiers for more recording time. SquadCast's AI tools, like filler word removal and overdub, enhance editing efficiency. Its progressive upload technology minimizes data loss, and integrations with tools like Descript streamline workflows.

## Local Recording Tip

**Key Features: Always record locally when possible**

Recording locally on each participant's device, as supported by platforms like Riverside.fm and Zencastr, ensures the highest audio quality by avoiding internet compression. These tools record uncompressed WAV files locally and upload them to the cloud, bypassing issues like lag or dropouts. For Zoom, local recording requires separate software (e.g., Audacity) and coordination, but it's critical for professional results. SquadCast's progressive upload and Zencastr's Dropbox integration further secure recordings. Local recording minimizes reliance on internet stability, making it the gold standard for remote podcasting, especially for interviews or co-hosted shows requiring clean, editable tracks. Always brief guests to use external mics and headphones in a quiet environment to maximize quality.

Managers select remote recording tools based on their quality requirements, budget, and technical capabilities, ensuring optimal audio quality for professional podcast production.
