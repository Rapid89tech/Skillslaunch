## Essential Tools for XLR Microphones in Podcasting

To achieve professional-grade audio with XLR microphones, selecting the right audio interface is crucial. Below, we explore the necessity of an audio interface for XLR mics and evaluate three popular options—Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, PreSonus AudioBox USB, and Behringer UMC22—along with considerations for accommodating multiple microphones.

## Audio Interface for XLR Microphones

**Key Features: Converts analog to digital for XLR mics**

XLR microphones, known for their superior sound quality, produce analog signals that require conversion to digital for computer-based recording. An audio interface serves as the bridge, equipped with preamps to amplify the signal and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to ensure clarity. This setup is essential for podcasters aiming for professional audio, as it surpasses the quality of built-in computer sound cards. Interfaces like the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 offer clean preamps and low-latency performance, ideal for capturing vocals or instruments. By investing in a quality interface, you ensure crisp, high-fidelity recordings, whether for solo episodes or multi-guest discussions. The interface also provides phantom power (48V) for condenser mics, a critical feature for many XLR models. Choosing an interface with intuitive controls and reliable drivers enhances your workflow, making it easier to focus on content creation rather than technical issues.

## Focusrite Scarlett 2i2

**Key Features: Studio-quality 2-in, 2-out interface**

The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (4th Gen) is a top choice for podcasters and musicians, renowned for its high-quality preamps and robust build. With two XLR/line combo inputs, it supports simultaneous recording of two microphones, perfect for interviews or co-hosted shows. Its 24-bit/192kHz resolution ensures pristine audio, while features like Auto Gain and Clip Safe simplify level setting for beginners. The re-engineered Air mode adds a musical presence, mimicking classic studio consoles. USB-C powered and compatible with Mac/PC, it's portable and user-friendly. The Scarlett 2i2 includes a software bundle with Ableton Live Lite and Hitmaker Expansion, enhancing production capabilities. However, its rear-panel XLR inputs may be less convenient for some setups. This interface strikes a balance between affordability and professional performance, making it ideal for podcasters seeking quality without complexity.

## PreSonus AudioBox USB

**Key Features: Compact, budget-friendly 2-in, 2-out interface**

The PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 is a solid option for budget-conscious podcasters needing reliable XLR mic support. It features two XLR/line combo inputs with 48V phantom power, suitable for condenser mics, and records at 24-bit/96kHz resolution. Its compact, bus-powered design makes it ideal for mobile recording, and the included Studio One Artist software provides a complete recording solution. The AudioBox offers low-latency monitoring via an internal mixer, blending input and playback signals. While it lacks the advanced features of the Scarlett 2i2, such as Auto Gain or higher sample rates, its rugged steel chassis ensures durability. The rear headphone jack may be inconvenient, and direct monitoring is mono-only, but for beginners or those recording on the go, it delivers excellent value and simplicity.

## Behringer UMC22

**Key Features: Affordable interface for basic recording needs**

The Behringer U-Phoria UMC22 is a budget-friendly choice for podcasters starting with XLR mics. It features one XLR input with 48V phantom power and one instrument input, supporting 24-bit/48kHz recording. Equipped with a MIDAS-designed preamp, it delivers surprisingly good audio quality for its price, ideal for solo podcasters or small setups. The UMC22 is bus-powered, compact, and easy to use, though it lacks the dual XLR inputs of the Scarlett or AudioBox, limiting it to single-mic recordings. Its build quality is less robust, with mixed user reviews on durability, but it's a cost-effective entry point for beginners. The UMC22 suits those prioritizing affordability over advanced features, though podcasters needing multiple inputs may need to upgrade.

## Multiple Microphone Inputs

**Key Features: Ensure enough inputs for 2+ mics**

When recording with two or more XLR microphones, your audio interface must have sufficient inputs to handle simultaneous recordings. Interfaces like the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 offer two XLR/line combo inputs, ideal for interviews or co-hosted podcasts. For larger setups, interfaces like the Behringer UMC404HD provide four inputs, supporting band recordings or multi-guest panels. Each input should include phantom power for condenser mics and independent gain controls for flexibility. Multi-track recording capabilities are crucial, allowing separate editing of each mic's audio to balance levels or remove noise. When choosing an interface, consider future expansion—extra inputs provide room to grow. Ensure compatibility with your DAW and check for low-latency performance to avoid delays during recording. Selecting an interface with adequate inputs ensures seamless, professional multi-mic recordings.

Managers select audio interfaces based on their current and future recording needs, ensuring professional audio quality and workflow efficiency.
