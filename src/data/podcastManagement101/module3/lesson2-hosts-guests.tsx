# Number of Hosts/Guests

https://youtu.be/FdkcLfm14O4

## Key Features: In-person or remote?

The number of hosts and guests, and whether they're in-person or remote, significantly impacts your podcast setup. A solo host might need just a quality microphone and basic recording software, while multiple hosts or guests require tools to manage several audio inputs. In-person recordings benefit from studio-grade equipment like mixers, whereas remote setups rely on platforms like Riverside or Zencastr for high-quality audio and video capture. Managing remote guests involves ensuring stable internet connections and backup recordings to avoid disruptions. For example, a podcast with frequent guest interviews needs software that supports easy scheduling and reliable audio quality across distances. Planning for the number of participants and their locations ensures smooth recording sessions and minimizes technical hiccups. This consideration also affects editing, as multi-track recordings for each speaker simplify post-production adjustments. By addressing this early, you can select tools that accommodate your team's size and geographic spread, ensuring professional output regardless of setup.

## In-Person vs Remote Considerations

üè† **In-Person Recording**:
- Studio-grade equipment (mixers, multiple microphones)
- Acoustic treatment for the recording space
- Direct monitoring and real-time adjustments
- Higher audio quality potential
- Requires physical space coordination

üåê **Remote Recording**:
- Reliable internet connection for all participants
- Remote recording platforms (Riverside, Zencastr, SquadCast)
- Individual microphone setups for each participant
- Local recording capabilities for backup
- Scheduling and time zone coordination

## Equipment Scaling

Your equipment needs scale with participant count:

- **1-2 people**: Basic USB microphone or simple XLR setup
- **3-4 people**: Multi-input audio interface, individual microphones
- **5+ people**: Mixer or advanced interface, professional monitoring setup
- **Remote participants**: Each needs their own microphone and stable internet

Managers plan equipment purchases based on current and future participant numbers, ensuring scalability for podcast growth.
