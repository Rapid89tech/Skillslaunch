# Ladder Safety and Scaffolding ðŸªœ

## Introduction

Ladders and scaffolds are critical for roofing tasks but account for 25% of construction falls (OSHA data). Proper selection, setup, and inspection ensure safety and compliance with OSHA Subparts L and X.

Mastering ladder and scaffold safety equips learners to prevent accidents, supported by course simulations and video tutorials.

* **Ladder Selection and Setup**  
  * **Description**: Choose appropriate ladders (e.g., step, extension) and set up correctly to prevent falls, per OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart X.  
  * **Details**:  
    * **Types**: Step ladders (self-supporting, â‰¤20 feet), extension ladders (for roof access, â‰¤60 feet), fixed ladders (â‰¥24 feet with cages).  
    * **Duty Rating**: Select based on load (e.g., Type IA: 300 lbs for heavy-duty roofing). Avoid metal ladders near electrical sources (e.g., <10 feet from power lines).  
    * **Setup**: Maintain 4:1 angle (1 foot out per 4 feet up), extend 3 feet above landing, secure at top/bottom with ties or stabilizers.  
    * **Challenges**: Incorrect angle (e.g., >4:1) or unstable surfaces cause 30% of ladder falls.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use level ground, verify duty rating, and inspect for defects (e.g., cracked rungs, loose bolts) before use.  
    * **Tools**: Level, ladder stabilizers, tie-off ropes, inspection checklist.  
  * **Impact**: Proper setup reduces falls by 60%, saving $5,000â€“$20,000 per incident.  

* **Ladder Use and Climbing Practices**  
  * **Description**: Follow safe climbing techniques to maintain stability and prevent falls, per OSHA 1926.1053.  
  * **Details**:  
    * **Techniques**: Maintain 3-point contact (two hands, one foot or vice versa), face ladder, keep belt buckle between rails, use tool belts instead of carrying tools.  
    * **Applications**: Essential for roof access, shingle installation, or maintenance tasks.  
    * **Challenges**: Overreaching or carrying tools in hand causes 20% of ladder injuries.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Train workers on 3-point contact, prohibit standing on top rungs, and use hoist systems for heavy materials.  
    * **Tools**: Tool belts, material hoists, safety signage.  
  * **Impact**: Safe practices prevent 50% of ladder-related injuries, saving $2,000â€“$10,000 per incident.  

* **Scaffold Setup and Inspection**  
  * **Description**: Erect scaffolds under qualified supervision, ensuring stability and guardrails, per OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart L.  
  * **Details**:  
    * **Requirements**: Support 4x intended load (e.g., 1,000 lbs for 250-lb load), include guardrails (42-inch top rail, 21-inch mid-rail) at â‰¥10 feet, fully plank platforms (â‰¥18 inches wide).  
    * **Setup**: Use base plates or mud sills on level ground, tie to structure (e.g., every 26 feet vertically), and ensure plumb/square alignment.  
    * **Inspections**: Conduct by competent person before each shift, checking for loose connections, missing planks, or damaged components.  
    * **Challenges**: Unstable bases or missing guardrails cause 25% of scaffold collapses.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use certified scaffold components, train erectors, and tag defective parts for removal.  
    * **Tools**: Base plates, guardrail kits, plumb level, inspection checklist.  
  * **Impact**: Proper setup reduces collapse risks by 70%, saving $10,000â€“$50,000 per incident.  

* **Scaffold Use Safety**  
  * **Description**: Follow safe practices to prevent falls or collapses during scaffold use, per OSHA 1926.451.  
  * **Details**:  
    * **Techniques**: Use designated access (e.g., ladders, stair towers), keep platforms clear of debris, avoid overloading, and lock casters on rolling scaffolds.  
    * **Applications**: Critical for roofing tasks like membrane installation or flashing repairs.  
    * **Challenges**: Climbing cross-bracing or moving occupied rolling scaffolds causes 15% of scaffold injuries.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Train workers on access protocols, enforce load limits, and prohibit work during high winds (>24 mph).  
    * **Tools**: Access ladders, lockable casters, warning signage.  
  * **Impact**: Safe use prevents 60% of scaffold injuries, saving $5,000â€“$20,000 per incident.
