* **Shingles**: Machine-cut, smooth, uniform, thinner, easier to install.
* **Shakes**: Hand-split, rustic, thicker, more labor-intensive.

Shingles and shakes differ in appearance and production, impacting installation and cost. Shingles offer a polished look with streamlined installation, while shakes provide a rugged aesthetic requiring skilled labor. Understanding these differences helps learners select the right option for aesthetic and budget needs, supported by course resources for practical application.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

* **Advantages**: Natural aesthetic, good insulation, lightweight, eco-friendly, breathable.
* **Disadvantages**: Fire risk, high maintenance, prone to rot/insects, shorter lifespan (20â€“40 years).

Wood roofing's natural beauty and insulation make it ideal for eco-conscious designs, but its flammability and maintenance needs pose challenges. Fire retardants and preservatives mitigate risks, but regular upkeep is essential. Learners mastering wood roofing can deliver charming, sustainable roofs, using course tools to manage maintenance and ensure longevity.

## Installation and Maintenance

* **Roof Pitch**: Minimum 4:12 for water runoff.
* **Underlayment**: Breathable felt to prevent moisture buildup.
* **Fasteners**: Stainless steel/galvanized nails to avoid rust.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect for cracks/moss, clean debris, re-treat with preservatives.

Wood roofing installation requires careful spacing and ventilation to prevent moisture issues, with rust-resistant fasteners ensuring durability. Maintenance involves regular inspections and treatments to combat rot or fire risks. These practices, supported by course simulations, prepare learners to install and maintain wood roofs effectively, ensuring aesthetic and functional longevity.
