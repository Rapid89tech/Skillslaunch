# Preparing the Roof Deck ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/wnPsUNeENFA

Preparing the roof deck is the foundation of a durable roofing system, ensuring a stable, level surface for underlayment and roofing materials.

Proper deck preparation is critical for preventing leaks, ensuring structural integrity, and complying with codes. It sets the stage for all subsequent roofing layers, making it essential for learners to master inspection, repair, and preparation techniques, supported by course resources for practical application.

## Objectives and Materials

* **Objectives**: Ensure a sound, level, clean, and dry deck; repair damage; comply with codes.
* **Materials**: Plywood (1/2"â€“5/8"), OSB, tongue-and-groove planks, metal decking (commercial).

---

## Inspection and Preparation Steps

* **Inspection**: Check for rot, warping, loose fasteners, delamination, mold.
* **Steps**:
  1. **Clear Deck**: Remove old materials, nails, debris; sweep clean.
  2. **Secure Fasteners**: Re-nail/screw loose panels (ring-shank nails/screws).
  3. **Replace Damage**: Cut out/replace rotted sections with matching material.
  4. **Level Surface**: Plane humps, shim low spots for flatness.
  5. **Moisture Barrier**: Apply vapor barrier/sealant if required.

## Safety and Code Compliance

* **Safety**: Use fall protection, inspect for rot hazards, clear debris/nails.
* **Codes**: Meet local requirements for material thickness, span ratings, fastener spacing.

Proper deck preparation ensures a stable foundation, preventing issues like leaks or structural failure. Course simulations help learners master inspection and repair techniques, ensuring compliance and durability.

## Discussion Questions

* Why replace rotted/delaminated decking?
* What are the consequences of installing shingles over uneven/soft decking?
* How do OSB and plywood differ in durability/moisture resistance?
* What safety measures are critical for deck preparation?
* How do local codes influence deck material/fastener choices?
