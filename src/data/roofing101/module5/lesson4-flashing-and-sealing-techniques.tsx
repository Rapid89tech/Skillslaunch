# Flashing and Sealing Techniques ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

Flashing and sealing prevent water intrusion at roof joints, penetrations, and edges, ensuring a watertight system critical for roof longevity.

These techniques are essential for protecting vulnerable areas where roofing materials alone are insufficient. Learners mastering flashing and sealing can prevent leaks and structural damage, supported by course resources for practical application.

* **Types**: Step, continuous, valley, drip edge, counter, vent pipe.  
* **Materials**:  
  * **Galvanized Steel**: Durable, affordable.  
  * **Aluminum**: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant.  
  * **Copper**: Long-lasting, decorative.  
  * **Lead**: Flexible, self-sealing.  
  * **Bituminous Membrane**: Self-adhesive, easy to apply.

* **Sealants**:  
  * **Polyurethane**: Flexible, UV-resistant, paintable.  
  * **Silicone**: Waterproof, non-paintable, durable.  
  * **Butyl Rubber**: Sticky, ideal for metal roofs.  
  * **Roof Cement**: Bitumen-based, for repairs/flashing.  
* **Application**: Apply on clean/dry surfaces, use proper bead thickness, avoid over-sealing moving joints.

## Installation and Best Practices

* **Flashing**: Install before roofing material, over underlayment; overlap with water flow, use compatible metals.  
* **Sealing**: Use compatible sealants, apply sparingly, prioritize flashing as primary defense.  
* **Key Locations**: Valleys, chimneys, vents, skylights, eaves, roof-to-wall intersections.

## Discussion Questions

* Why is step flashing preferred over continuous flashing on sloped intersections?  
* What issues arise if flashing is not installed under siding?  
* How does counter flashing enhance step flashing?  
* What are signs of failed roof sealant?  
* How do flashing requirements differ for metal roofs?
