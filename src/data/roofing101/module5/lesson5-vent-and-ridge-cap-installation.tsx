# Vent and Ridge Cap Installation ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/v33nWJaWGRs

Ventilation and ridge cap installation ensure proper airflow and a finished, watertight roof, critical for temperature control, moisture prevention, and durability.

These components enhance roof lifespan and energy efficiency. Learners mastering vent and ridge cap installation can create balanced, durable systems, supported by course simulations for practical application.

## Ventilation Types and Purpose

* **Purpose**: Reduce heat/moisture, prevent mold/ice dams, extend roof life, improve energy efficiency.  
* **Vent Types**: Ridge, soffit, gable, turbine, power, box (static).

## Ridge Vent and Cap Installation

* **Ridge Vent**:  
  * **Tools**: Ridge vent, nails, circular saw, roofing adhesive.  
  * **Steps**: Cut 1" slot along ridge (leave 6" uncut ends), install vent, secure with nails, seal ends/joints.  
* **Ridge Cap Shingles**:  
  * **Steps**: Use pre-cut caps or cut 3-tab shingles, overlap 5", nail 6" apart, seal final cap.

## Balanced Ventilation and Maintenance

* **Balanced System**: 1 sq. ft. NFA per 300 sq. ft. attic, split equally between intake (soffit) and exhaust (ridge).  
* **Maintenance**: Inspect vents/caps annually, clear debris, replace damaged sections.

## Discussion Questions

* Why is balanced ventilation critical?  
* What happens if ridge caps are improperly nailed?  
* How do you inspect a ridge vent from inside the attic?  
* Can ridge vents be used with gable vents? Why or why not?
