# Laying Underlayment and Starter Shingles ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/gsRY0OXj6Oo

Underlayment and starter shingles form the critical base layers for roofing, providing waterproofing and edge protection for the final covering.

These layers ensure long-term roof performance by preventing leaks and enhancing wind resistance. Understanding their installation is essential for learners to create durable, weather-resistant roofs, supported by course tools for practical mastery.

## Underlayment Types and Installation

* **Types**:  
  * **Asphalt-Saturated Felt**: Economical, 15/30 lb weights.  
  * **Synthetic**: Lightweight, durable, UV-resistant.  
  * **Self-Adhering Membrane**: Rubberized asphalt for valleys/eaves.  
* **Installation**:  
  * Start at eaves, roll horizontally, overlap 2"â€“4" (horizontal), 6" (vertical).  
  * Fasten with nails/staples (except self-adhering).  
  * Use ice and water shield in valleys, eaves, cold climates.

## Starter Shingles Installation

* **Purpose**: Seal eaves/rakes, provide wind resistance, align first course.  
* **Types**: Pre-manufactured strips, cut-down 3-tab shingles.  
* **Installation**:  
  * Lay at eaves with adhesive facing edge, overhang 1/4"â€“3/8".  
  * Nail 4â€“6" from bottom edge, butt ends tightly.  
  * Install along rakes for wind protection.

## Best Practices and Common Mistakes

* **Best Practices**: Install underlayment before starters, align precisely, use compatible materials.  
* **Mistakes to Avoid**: Skipping underlayment, misaligning starters, inadequate overlap, using full shingles as starters.

Mastering underlayment and starter shingle installation ensures a watertight, durable roof base. Course simulations help learners avoid common errors, ensuring professional results.

## Discussion Questions

* Why use starter shingles instead of regular shingles?  
* How does underlayment extend roof lifespan?  
* What are the advantages of synthetic over asphalt felt underlayment?  
* Where should self-adhering membranes be applied?  
* How does incorrect starter shingle installation affect performance?
