# Shingle, Tile, and Metal Panel Installation ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

Installing shingles, tiles, or metal panels requires precision to ensure durability, weather resistance, and aesthetic appeal, with each material demanding specific techniques.

Proper installation of these coverings ensures long-term performance and compliance with codes. Learners mastering these techniques can deliver high-quality roofs, supported by course resources for practical application.

## Installation Techniques

* **Asphalt Shingles**:

  * **Tools**: Roofing hammer/nail gun, chalk line, utility knife, fall protection.  
  * **Steps**: Snap chalk lines, start over starter strip, nail (4â€“6 per shingle), stagger seams, cap ridges.  
  * **Key Details**: 5"â€“6" exposure, 1/4"â€“3/8" overhang.  
      
* **Roof Tiles (Concrete/Clay)**:

  * **Tools**: Tile cutter/wet saw, hammer, nails/screws, tile clips.  
  * **Steps**: Install battens, start at eaves, nail/screw tiles, overlap for water shedding, mortar ridges.  
  * **Key Details**: Allow expansion gaps, use flashing at penetrations.  
      
* **Metal Panels (Corrugated/Standing Seam)**:

  * **Tools**: Metal snips, impact driver, gasketed screws, sealant.  
  * **Steps**: Install closure strips, lay panels square, fasten with screws, overlap 1â€“2 ribs, seal ridges/valleys.  
  * **Key Details**: Avoid overtightening screws, use panel-specific flashings.
