# Gutters and Downspouts ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

Gutters and downspouts direct rainwater away from buildings, protecting foundations, walls, and landscaping.

Gutters and downspouts are essential for managing water runoff, preventing structural damage, and maintaining roof longevity. Understanding their types and installation equips learners to create effective drainage systems, supported by course resources for practical mastery.

## Types and Materials

* **Gutter Types**: K-style, half-round, box, fascia gutters.
* **Materials**: Aluminum (light, rust-resistant), galvanized steel (durable), copper (attractive, costly), vinyl (affordable, brittle), zinc (long-lasting).
* **Downspouts**: Rectangular, round, flexible; include splash blocks/extensions.

## Installation and Maintenance

* **Installation**: Slope 1/4" per 10 feet toward downspouts; hangers every 2â€“3 feet; seal joints.
* **Maintenance**: Clean twice yearly, inspect for leaks/sagging, install guards, prevent ice dams with ventilation.

Proper gutter installation and maintenance ensure effective water management and structural protection. Course tools help learners master slope calculations and cleaning techniques, preventing issues like overflow or foundation damage.
