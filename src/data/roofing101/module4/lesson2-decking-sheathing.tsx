# Decking / Sheathing ðŸªµ

## Definition of Decking (Sheathing)

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/P5sxLpTDYIM

Roof decking (sheathing) is the structural base layer attached to roof framing, providing a stable surface for roofing materials.

Decking is critical for supporting roofing systems, distributing loads, and protecting against weather. It serves as the foundation for materials like shingles or tiles, ensuring structural integrity. Understanding decking types and installation equips learners to create durable, code-compliant roofs, supported by course resources for practical mastery.

## Functions of Roof Decking

* **Structural Support**: Distributes weight across trusses/rafters.
* **Fastening Base**: Surface for nailing/screwing roofing materials.
* **Weather Barrier**: Resists wind uplift and moisture with proper sealing.
* **Fire/Insulation**: Enhances fire resistance and thermal performance (special types).

Decking ensures a roof's structural stability and longevity, supporting materials and resisting environmental stresses. Proper installation and material choice are critical for performance, making it essential for learners to master decking practices for reliable roofing systems.

## Common Types of Decking Materials

| Material Type | Description | Typical Uses |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Plywood** | Glued wood veneer layers, strong | Residential/commercial roofs |
| **OSB** | Compressed wood strands, cost-effective | Most common modern choice |
| **Plank Sheathing** | Solid wood boards (1x6/1x8) | Historical homes, tile roofs |
| **Tongue-and-Groove** | Interlocking planks | Exposed beam ceilings, upscale roofs |
| **Metal Decking** | Corrugated steel panels | Industrial/commercial flat roofs |
| **Concrete Decking** | Poured/precast concrete slabs | High-rise/flat roofs |

## Installation and Maintenance

* **Thickness/Span**: 7/16" OSB or 15/32" plywood minimum for asphalt shingles; varies by load/rafter spacing.
* **Fastening**: Nails/screws at 6" edge, 12" center spacing.
* **Ventilation Gaps**: 1/8" gaps for moisture expansion.
* **Underlayment**: Protects decking during installation.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect for sagging, leaks, rot, or mold; replace damaged sections before re-roofing.

Proper decking installation ensures a stable, durable base, while regular maintenance prevents costly repairs. Course simulations help learners master fastening and inspection techniques, ensuring compliance with building codes and optimal roofing performance.
