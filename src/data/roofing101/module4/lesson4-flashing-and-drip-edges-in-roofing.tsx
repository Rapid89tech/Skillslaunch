# Flashing and Drip Edges in Roofing ðŸ§¾

## Introduction

Flashing and drip edges are metal components that seal roof joints and edges, preventing water intrusion and protecting the structure.

Flashing and drip edges are vital for waterproofing vulnerable roof areas, ensuring longevity and preventing costly damage. Understanding their types and installation equips learners to create leak-free roofs, supported by course simulations for practical mastery.

## Types and Functions

* **Flashing**:
  * **Purpose**: Directs water away from joints (chimneys, vents, walls), prevents leaks, protects underlayment/decking.
  * **Types**: Step, valley, vent pipe, chimney, skylight, drip edge, kick-out, continuous.

* **Drip Edges**:
  * **Purpose**: Guides water into gutters, prevents wicking under shingles, protects fascia.
  * **Materials**: Galvanized steel, aluminum, copper; L- or T-shaped profiles.

## Installation and Maintenance

* **Flashing**: Install over underlayment, under roofing materials; use compatible metals, seal joints, overlap with water flow.
* **Drip Edge**: Under underlayment at eaves, over at rakes; overlap 2 inches, extend Â½â€“1" beyond deck.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect for corrosion, leaks, or loose fasteners; reseal/replace as needed.

Proper installation and maintenance of flashing and drip edges ensure waterproofing and durability. Course resources help learners master techniques, preventing common issues like leaks or corrosion.
