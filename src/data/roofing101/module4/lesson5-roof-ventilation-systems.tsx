## Introduction to Roof Ventilation

**YOUTUBE LINK** https://youtu.be/MVkd-D1EBY4

Roof ventilation ensures air circulation in the attic/roof space, reducing heat, moisture, and extending roof lifespan through balanced intake and exhaust vents.

Ventilation is critical for maintaining roof durability and indoor comfort, preventing issues like mold or ice dams. Understanding ventilation systems equips learners to design and install effective solutions, supported by course tools for practical application.

## Purpose and Types

* **Purpose**: Reduces heat, controls moisture, prevents ice dams, improves comfort, extends roof life.
* **Types**:
  * **Passive**: Ridge, soffit, gable vents, roof louvers (natural airflow).
  * **Active**: Power ventilator fans, solar-powered vents, turbine vents (mechanical airflow).

---

## Installation and Maintenance

* **Balanced Ventilation**: 1 sq. ft. vent per 150 sq. ft. attic (1:1 intake/exhaust).
* **Installation**: Intake vents low (soffits), exhaust vents high (ridge); avoid mixing exhaust types.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect annually, clear debris, check for rust or damage, ensure clear airflow.

Proper ventilation design and maintenance enhance roof performance and energy efficiency. Course simulations help learners master system balance and troubleshooting, ensuring optimal airflow and durability.

## Discussion Questions

* Why is balanced ventilation critical?
* How does ventilation prevent ice dams?
* What risks arise from poor ventilation?
* How do passive and active ventilation differ?
* How should soffit and ridge vents be installed?
