## **Steps for Simulated Roofing Installation**

### **Steps for Simulated Installation**

#### **1. Review Roof Plans and Manufacturer Instructions**
- **Purpose**: Ensure the installation aligns with design specifications, material requirements, and industry standards to achieve a durable, code-compliant roof system.
- **Process**: Trainees study detailed blueprints or mock-up plans, typically scaled-down versions (e.g., 4x4 ft or 8x8 ft sections) of a gable, hip, or flat roof. Plans specify material types (e.g., asphalt shingles, TPO membrane), dimensions, and component placement (e.g., vents, flashing).
- **Manufacturer Instructions**: Review guidelines from manufacturers (e.g., GAF, CertainTeed for shingles; Firestone for TPO) for installation specifics, such as nailing patterns (4â€“6 nails per shingle per ASTM D3462), overlap requirements (e.g., 5â€“6 inches for shingles), or adhesive application for membranes.
- **Standards and Codes**: Ensure compliance with standards like ASTM D226 (underlayment), ASTM D3161 (wind resistance), or International Building Code (IBC) ventilation requirements (e.g., 1:150 ratio for attic airflow). Trainees may also review NRCA manuals or OSHA safety guidelines (e.g., OSHA 1926.501 for fall protection).

#### **2. Prepare Mock-Up Deck**
- **Purpose**: Create a stable, smooth foundation mimicking a real roof deck to support subsequent layers and ensure accurate installation practice.
- **Process**: Construct a mock-up deck using plywood (minimum 5/8 inch per IBC) or oriented strand board (OSB) on a lab frame or platform. The deck is inspected for smoothness, with protruding nails removed and gaps filled to prevent underlayment tears.
- **Structural Integrity**: Secure loose boards with 8d nails or screws at 6-inch intervals to ensure stability, simulating on-site deck preparation. For flat roof mock-ups, a concrete-like surface may be used to replicate commercial decks.

#### **3. Install Base Layers (Underlayment, Insulation)**
- **Purpose**: Establish a waterproof and insulated foundation to protect the structure and enhance energy efficiency.
- **Underlayment Installation**: Lay 15-lb or 30-lb felt (ASTM D226) or synthetic underlayment (e.g., GAF Tiger Paw) with 2â€“4 inch overlaps (2 inches horizontal, 4â€“6 inches vertical). Secure with roofing nails or plastic cap nails at 6â€“12 inch intervals, ensuring no wrinkles or tears. Self-adhered membranes (e.g., ice and water shields) are used in vulnerable areas like valleys or eaves.
- **Insulation Installation**: For energy-efficient mock-ups, install insulation like polyisocyanurate (R-5 to R-7 per inch) or expanded polystyrene (EPS, R-3.8 per inch) beneath or above the deck. Insulation is cut to fit precisely, avoiding gaps that reduce R-value (target R-20 to R-40 per IECC standards).

#### **4. Apply Roofing Materials per Specifications**
- **Purpose**: Install the primary roofing material to provide weather protection, aesthetics, and durability, adhering to manufacturer and code standards.
- **Asphalt Shingles**: Align shingles with 5â€“6 inch exposure, staggered seams, and 4â€“6 nails per shingle (per ASTM D3462). Starter strips are installed along eaves, and ridge caps cover peaks. Trainees practice cutting shingles for valleys or penetrations using roofing knives.
- **Metal Roofs**: Secure panels (e.g., standing seam, corrugated) with screws or clips, maintaining 1/4â€“1/2 inch expansion gaps for thermal movement. Seams are locked mechanically or sealed with butyl tape for weather-tightness.
- **Flat Roof Membranes**: Lay TPO, EPDM, or PVC membranes with 3â€“6 inch seam overlaps, heat-welding (TPO/PVC) or adhering (EPDM) seams per ASTM D5957. Ensure a 1/4 inch per foot slope for drainage.

#### **5. Seal Penetrations and Add Flashing**
- **Purpose**: Ensure watertight transitions around roof penetrations and seams to prevent leaks, a leading cause of roofing failures.
- **Process**: Install flashing around mock penetrations (e.g., vents, skylights, chimneys) using materials like aluminum, galvanized steel, or membrane-based flashing (for flat roofs). Step flashing is used for sloped intersections, overlapping 2â€“3 inches, while counterflashing protects vertical transitions.
- **Sealing Techniques**: Apply roofing cement or sealant (e.g., butyl rubber, silicone) to secure flashing edges. For membranes, heat-weld or adhere flashing to ensure seam integrity. Trainees practice cutting flashing to fit complex shapes, such as curved skylights.

#### **6. Verify Alignment, Fastening, and Quality**
- **Purpose**: Confirm the installation meets aesthetic, structural, and performance standards, ensuring durability and code compliance.
- **Alignment Checks**: Verify shingle or panel alignment using chalk lines or laser levels, ensuring straight lines and consistent exposure (e.g., 5â€“6 inches for shingles). Misaligned materials affect aesthetics and wind resistance.
- **Fastening Verification**: Inspect fastener placement (e.g., 1 inch above shingle cutouts, 3/4 inch deck penetration) and quantity (e.g., 4â€“6 nails per shingle). Over- or under-driven fasteners are corrected to prevent uplift or material damage.
- **Quality Control**: Use tools like thermal scanners (for insulation gaps), moisture meters (for leaks), or visual inspections to ensure watertightness and compliance with standards (e.g., ASTM D3161 for wind resistance). Labs may simulate rain or wind to test performance.

#### **7. Troubleshoot Issues**
- **Purpose**: Identify and resolve common installation issues, such as leaks or misaligned materials, to prepare for real-world challenges.
- **Common Issues**: Labs simulate problems like leaks (e.g., from poor flashing), misaligned shingles (causing wind vulnerability), or inadequate ventilation (leading to heat buildup). For example, a mock-up may include a poorly sealed valley to practice corrective techniques.
- **Troubleshooting Techniques**: Trainees learn to use leak detectors to locate water paths, adjust nailing patterns for wind resistance, or add flashing to fix penetrations. For instance, a misaligned shingle row is removed and reinstalled with proper overlap.

#### **8. Clean Up and Document the Process**
- **Purpose**: Maintain a safe, organized workspace and record the installation process for training, quality assurance, and certification purposes.
- **Cleanup Process**: Remove debris (e.g., shingle cutoffs, packaging) from the mock-up area to prevent hazards and maintain a professional environment, mirroring OSHA 1926.25 requirements for clean worksites. Materials are sorted for recycling (e.g., metal scraps, cardboard).
- **Documentation**: Trainees document the installation process, including materials used, techniques applied, and issues resolved. This may involve photos, written logs, or digital reports (e.g., using software like JobNimbus). Documentation supports certification requirements (e.g., NRCA ProCertification) and reinforces learning.

## **Troubleshooting and Safety**

### **Common Issues**
- Improper overlap causing potential leaks (e.g., shingles <5 inches overlap).
- Incorrect fastener placement damaging materials (e.g., overdriven nails).
- Poor seam adhesion in membranes, leading to water intrusion.
- Misaligned tiles or panels affecting aesthetics and performance.
- Inadequate ventilation causing heat/moisture buildup.

### **Prevention**
- Use guards on power tools and keep bystanders clear.
