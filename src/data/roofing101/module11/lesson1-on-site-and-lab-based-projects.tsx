# On-Site and Lab-Based Projects

## Introduction
This lesson covers the practical application of roofing skills through hands-on projects in both on-site and laboratory settings.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between on-site and lab-based roofing projects
- Learn safety protocols for both environments
- Develop practical skills through hands-on experience
- Master project planning and execution techniques

## On-Site Projects
On-site projects provide real-world experience with actual roofing installations and repairs.

### Key Considerations
- Weather conditions and their impact on work
- Safety protocols for working at heights
- Coordination with other construction trades
- Client communication and project management

## Lab-Based Projects
Laboratory settings allow for controlled learning environments where students can practice techniques safely.

### Advantages
- Controlled environment for skill development
- Immediate feedback from instructors
- Opportunity to practice complex techniques
- Reduced risk compared to on-site work

## Project Types

### 1. Shingle Installation Projects
- Practice proper shingle alignment and nailing
- Learn about different shingle types and their installation methods
- Understand flashing installation around roof penetrations

### 2. Metal Roofing Projects
- Practice metal panel installation techniques
- Learn about proper fastening and sealing methods
- Understand expansion and contraction considerations

### 3. Flat Roof Projects
- Practice membrane installation techniques
- Learn about proper drainage and slope requirements
- Understand different flat roof systems

## Safety Protocols

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Hard hats and safety glasses
- Proper footwear with slip-resistant soles
- Fall protection equipment when working at heights
- Hearing protection when using power tools

### Tool Safety
- Regular inspection and maintenance of tools
- Proper storage and transportation of equipment
- Safe handling of sharp tools and materials

## Assessment Criteria
Students will be evaluated on:
- Proper technique execution
- Safety protocol adherence
- Project completion quality
- Time management skills
- Problem-solving abilities

## Conclusion
Both on-site and lab-based projects are essential components of roofing education, providing students with the practical skills and experience needed for successful careers in the roofing industry.
