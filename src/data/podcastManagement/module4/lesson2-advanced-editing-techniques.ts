# Basic Editing: Cutting, Noise Removal, Levels

## Why Basic Editing Matters

Even the best content can lose impact if the **audio is distracting or unpleasant**. Basic editing helps:

* Improve clarity
* Reduce distractions
* Maintain listener engagement

## I. Cutting Audio (Trimming and Deleting)

### Purpose of Podcast Editing

**Key Features: Remove mistakes, pauses, filler words, and tangents**

Podcast editing aims to polish raw audio by removing mistakes, retakes, long pauses, filler words ("ums," "uhs"), and off-topic tangents, ensuring a professional, engaging episode. Mistakes, like misspoken lines, can disrupt listener flow, while long pauses or filler words reduce polish, especially in interviews recorded via Riverside.fm. Cutting off-topic tangents keeps content focused, crucial for narrative or solo podcasts. For example, editing a 30-minute Zencastr recording might involve trimming 5 seconds of silence or removing a 2-minute irrelevant discussion. This process enhances clarity and pacing, maintaining listener attention across platforms like Spotify. Effective editing, whether using Audacity or Adobe Audition, transforms raw recordings into cohesive episodes, balancing natural speech with professional quality to meet audience expectations and elevate your podcast's impact.
