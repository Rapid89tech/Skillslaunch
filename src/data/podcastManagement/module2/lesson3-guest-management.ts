# Identifying and Researching Guests

## Why Have Guests on a Podcast?

Bringing in guests can:

* Add credibility and expertise to your show, enhancing trust.
* Expose your podcast to the guest's audience, boosting reach.
* Offer new perspectives and diverse voices, enriching content.
* Make your show more dynamic and engaging, improving listener retention.

Managers leverage guests to align with audience interests, using platforms like Podmatch to connect and promote episodes effectively.

## Part 1: Identifying Potential Guests

### What Makes a Good Guest?

| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Relevant Expertise** | Do they know the subject you want to cover? |
| **Speaking Skills** | Can they explain things clearly and confidently? |
| **Engagement History** | Have they been on other podcasts or interviews? |
| **Audience Alignment** | Will your listeners find them interesting? |
| **Reach or Influence** | Do they have a following to boost exposure? |

Managers prioritize guests who align with the podcast's niche, ensuring engaging, relevant discussions that resonate with listeners.

### Guest Categories by Type

**Subject Experts**: Academics or professionals add depth. Managers source them via LinkedIn for credibility.

**Influencers/Celebs**: Public figures expand reach. Managers target YouTubers or authors for cross-promotion.

**Industry Leaders**: CEOs or founders offer insights. Managers connect at conferences for high-value guests.

**Everyday Voices**: Testimonials add relatability. Managers use listener suggestions for authentic stories.

**Returning Guests**: Fan favorites boost loyalty. Managers schedule recurring guests to maintain engagement.

### Where to Find Podcast Guests

* Social Media Platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram)

* Industry Events/Conferences (speakers)
* Other Podcasts (similar show guests)
* Books & Blogs (authors)
* Your Own Network (mentors, colleagues)
* Listener Suggestions (audience input)

Managers use these sources to build a diverse guest roster, enhancing content variety and audience appeal.

## Part 2: Researching Podcast Guests

### Steps in Guest Research

1. **Check Their Online Presence**: Review LinkedIn, Twitter, or YouTube for background and style. Managers ensure guests align with the podcast's tone and audience expectations.

2. **Listen to Their Previous Interviews**: Gauge communication style and avoid repetitive questions. Managers note passions to tailor discussions, enhancing engagement.

3. **Read Their Work**: Books or blogs provide insights for unique angles. Managers pull quotes to enrich interviews, ensuring relevance to listeners.

4. **Find a Unique Angle**: Identify recent changes or unique opinions. Managers craft questions that align with audience interests, making episodes stand out.
