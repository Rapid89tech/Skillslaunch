## Developing Show Concepts and Formats

### 1. Define Your Podcast Concept

Start with the core idea of your show — this is your podcast's identity.

✅ **Key Questions to Ask:**
- What is the central theme or niche? 📍
- Who is your target audience? 🎯
- What problem do you solve or what value do you offer? 💡
- What makes your podcast unique? 🔥

💡 **Examples:**
- **Career Growth Podcast**: Helping young professionals climb the corporate ladder.
- **Mystery Fiction Podcast**: Audio drama series telling one mystery per season.
- **Food & Culture Podcast**: Exploring world cuisines and the stories behind them.

📘 **Concept Template:**
"[Podcast Name]" is a [weekly/bi-weekly] show that [describe goal/purpose] for [target audience]. Each episode explores [topic or format], offering [benefit/value].
