          - Your podcast host creates and maintains this feed
          - Think of it like a live "playlist" that updates automatically when you publish new episodes

          | Element | Description |

          | **Artwork** | Podcast cover image (minimum 1400x1400px, max 3000x3000px) |

          ### ‚úÖ B. Validate Your Feed
          
          Use tools like:
