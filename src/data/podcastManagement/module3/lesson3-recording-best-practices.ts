# Recording Best Practices

## Why This Matters

Even with the best equipment, poor recording practices can ruin your audio quality. Following these best practices ensures **professional sound quality**, **efficient workflow**, and **minimal post-production work**.

## I. Pre-Recording Preparation

### Equipment Testing

**Key Features: Test all equipment before recording**

Always test your complete recording setup before starting any podcast session. This includes checking microphones, audio interfaces, headphones, and recording software to ensure everything is working correctly. Test microphone levels to ensure they're not too quiet or too loud, and verify that all participants can hear each other clearly. For example, test your Shure SM7B with your Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 to ensure proper gain levels and no distortion. Check that your recording software (like Audacity or Adobe Audition) is capturing audio properly and that file formats and sample rates are set correctly. This pre-recording testing prevents technical issues during the actual recording session and ensures you don't waste time on unusable audio. It's especially important for remote recordings where you can't physically troubleshoot equipment issues during the session.

### Environment Setup

**Key Features: Create a quiet, acoustically treated space**

Set up your recording environment to minimize unwanted noise and echo. Choose a quiet room with minimal background noise from air conditioning, traffic, or other sources. Add acoustic treatment like foam panels, carpets, or blankets to absorb sound reflections and reduce echo. Position your microphone away from reflective surfaces like windows or bare walls. For example, record in a carpeted room with curtains on the windows and foam panels on the walls to create a dead acoustic environment. Consider the time of day for recording to avoid peak noise periods in your area. If recording at home, inform household members to minimize noise during your session. This careful environment setup significantly improves audio quality and reduces the need for extensive noise reduction in post-production.

### Backup Plans

**Key Features: Have alternative recording methods ready**

Always have backup plans in case of equipment failure or technical issues. This might include spare microphones, cables, or even alternative recording software. For remote recordings, have a backup platform ready in case your primary choice fails. Consider local recording as a backup for remote sessionsâ€”each participant can record their own audio locally and sync it later. For example, if Riverside.fm fails during a remote interview, you can quickly switch to Zoom or have participants record locally with Audacity. Keep backup files of your recording software and have cloud storage ready for backing up important recordings. These backup plans prevent lost content and ensure you can complete your recording session even if technical problems arise.

## II. Microphone Technique

### Proper Positioning

**Key Features: Position microphone 6-12 inches from mouth**

Position your microphone correctly to achieve optimal audio quality. For most podcasting microphones, position the mic 6-12 inches from your mouth, slightly off-axis to avoid direct breath and plosive sounds. The microphone should be at mouth level or slightly below to capture clear speech without picking up nasal sounds. For example, with a Shure SM7B, position it about 8 inches from your mouth, slightly to the side, to capture warm, clear vocals while minimizing breath noise. Avoid positioning the microphone directly in front of your mouth, as this can cause plosive sounds from letters like "p" and "b." Consistent positioning throughout your recording session ensures uniform audio quality and makes post-production easier.

### Pop Filter Usage

**Key Features: Use pop filter to reduce plosives**

Always use a pop filter or windscreen to reduce plosive sounds that can distort your audio. Position the pop filter between your mouth and the microphone, about 2-3 inches from the mic. This prevents bursts of air from hitting the microphone diaphragm and causing unwanted distortion. For example, when using a condenser microphone like the Audio-Technica AT2020, a pop filter is essential to prevent plosives from ruining your recording. If you don't have a pop filter, you can use a windscreen that fits over the microphone, though this is less effective than a proper pop filter. This simple accessory significantly improves audio quality and reduces the need for post-production fixes.

### Consistent Distance

**Key Features: Maintain consistent distance throughout recording**

Maintain a consistent distance from your microphone throughout the entire recording session. Moving closer or farther from the mic during recording creates inconsistent audio levels that are difficult to fix in post-production. Use a microphone stand or boom arm to help maintain consistent positioning, and avoid leaning forward or backward during the session. For example, if you start recording with your mouth 8 inches from a Rode PodMic, keep that distance throughout the entire episode. This consistency ensures uniform audio quality and makes editing much easier, as you won't need to constantly adjust levels for different parts of the recording.

## III. Audio Levels and Monitoring

### Setting Proper Gain

**Key Features: Set gain to avoid clipping while maintaining good signal**

Set your microphone gain to achieve optimal audio levels without clipping. Aim for peak levels around -12 to -6 dB, which provides good signal strength while leaving headroom to prevent distortion. Use your audio interface's gain control or software meters to monitor levels during recording. For example, with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, set the gain so that your loudest speech peaks around -6 dB on the level meters. Avoid setting gain too low, as this creates weak signals that require amplification in post-production, potentially introducing noise. Also avoid setting gain too high, as this can cause clipping and distortion that cannot be fixed later.

### Headphone Monitoring

**Key Features: Use headphones to monitor audio in real-time**

Always use closed-back headphones to monitor your audio during recording. This allows you to hear exactly what's being captured and catch any issues immediately. Headphones help you identify problems like microphone feedback, background noise, or level issues that might not be obvious otherwise. For example, using Sony MDR-7506 headphones lets you hear if your Shure SM7B is picking up room echo or if your gain levels are appropriate. This real-time monitoring enables immediate adjustments and prevents recording sessions with poor audio quality that would require extensive post-production work.

### Level Consistency

**Key Features: Maintain consistent levels throughout recording**

Work to maintain consistent audio levels throughout your recording session. This includes speaking at a consistent volume and avoiding sudden changes in microphone distance or positioning. Consistent levels make post-production much easier and result in a more professional-sounding final product. For example, if you're recording a 30-minute solo episode, maintain the same speaking volume and microphone distance throughout to ensure uniform audio quality. This consistency reduces the need for extensive level adjustments in editing and creates a more polished listening experience.

## IV. Recording Session Management

### Session Organization

**Key Features: Plan and organize your recording session**

Plan your recording session in advance to ensure efficiency and quality. Create a clear outline or script for your content, including any specific points you want to cover or questions you want to ask guests. Organize your recording space with all necessary equipment easily accessible. For example, have your microphone, headphones, notes, and any reference materials positioned where you can reach them without moving away from the mic. This organization prevents interruptions during recording and helps maintain focus on content rather than technical issues.

### Communication Protocols

**Key Features: Establish clear communication for multi-person recordings**

For recordings with multiple participants, establish clear communication protocols before starting. Decide on hand signals or verbal cues for technical issues, breaks, or retakes. Agree on how to handle interruptions, mistakes, or off-topic discussions. For example, establish that raising a hand means "stop recording" or that saying "cut" indicates a section that should be edited out. These protocols help maintain recording flow and make post-production more efficient by clearly marking sections that need attention.

### Quality Control

**Key Features: Monitor quality throughout the session**

Continuously monitor audio quality throughout your recording session. Listen for any changes in sound quality, background noise, or technical issues. If you notice problems, address them immediately rather than continuing with compromised audio. For example, if you hear a new background noise (like air conditioning turning on), pause recording and address it before continuing. This proactive approach prevents recording sessions with poor audio quality that would require extensive post-production work or complete re-recording.

## V. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Editing During Recording

**Key Features: Don't stop and restart for minor mistakes**

Avoid stopping and restarting your recording for minor mistakes or imperfections. This creates a choppy workflow and can make editing more difficult. Instead, continue recording and make a note of any issues to address in post-production. For example, if you stumble over a word, simply pause briefly and continue rather than stopping the entire recording. This approach maintains natural flow and makes the editing process more efficient.

### Ignoring Background Noise

**Key Features: Address noise issues before they affect quality**

Don't ignore background noise or assume it can be fixed in post-production. While some noise can be reduced with editing tools, it's much better to eliminate it at the source. Address issues like air conditioning, computer fans, or external noise before starting your recording. For example, if you hear traffic noise through your window, close the window or choose a different time to record. This proactive approach results in much better audio quality and reduces post-production workload.

### Poor File Management

**Key Features: Organize and backup your recordings properly**

Don't neglect proper file management for your recordings. Always save your files with clear, descriptive names and organize them in a logical folder structure. Create backups of important recordings immediately after completing them. For example, save your recording as "Episode_001_Interview_JohnDoe_2024-01-15.wav" and back it up to cloud storage or an external drive. This organization prevents lost files and makes it easier to find and work with your recordings later.

## VI. Advanced Techniques

### Room Tone Recording

**Key Features: Record room tone for noise reduction**

Record several seconds of room tone (silence in your recording environment) at the beginning or end of your session. This recording of background noise can be used in post-production for noise reduction and to fill gaps during editing. For example, record 10-15 seconds of silence in your room after completing your main recording. This room tone can be used to create seamless edits and improve overall audio quality.

### Multiple Takes

**Key Features: Record multiple takes for important content**

For important content or complex sections, consider recording multiple takes to give yourself options in post-production. This is especially useful for intros, outros, or key statements that need to be perfect. For example, record your podcast intro three times with slightly different deliveries, then choose the best one during editing. This approach increases your chances of getting the perfect take and reduces pressure during recording.

### Backup Recording

**Key Features: Use multiple recording methods for important sessions**

For important recording sessions, consider using multiple recording methods as a safety measure. This might include recording both locally and through a remote platform, or using both your main microphone and a backup device. For example, record your main audio through your Shure SM7B and interface, but also record a backup through your computer's built-in microphone. This redundancy ensures you don't lose important content due to technical failures.

## VII. Post-Recording Checklist

### Immediate Actions

**Key Features: Complete these tasks right after recording**

After completing your recording session, immediately complete these essential tasks. Listen to a brief sample of your recording to ensure audio quality is acceptable and no major issues occurred. Save your recording file with a clear, descriptive name and create a backup copy. Note any specific issues or sections that need attention during editing. For example, mark timestamps for any sections with background noise or mistakes that need to be addressed. This immediate review prevents surprises during editing and ensures you have a complete record of any issues.

### File Organization

**Key Features: Organize files for efficient workflow**

Organize your recording files in a logical structure that supports efficient workflow. Create folders for different types of content, episodes, or recording sessions. Use consistent naming conventions that include episode numbers, dates, and content descriptions. For example, organize files as "Podcast/Episode_001/Episode_001_Raw_Recording.wav" and "Podcast/Episode_001/Episode_001_Edited.wav". This organization makes it easier to find files, track progress, and maintain consistency across your podcast production.

### Quality Assessment

**Key Features: Evaluate recording quality before editing**

Before beginning the editing process, assess the overall quality of your recording. Listen to the entire recording to identify any issues that need to be addressed, such as background noise, level inconsistencies, or technical problems. Note specific timestamps for sections that need attention. This assessment helps you plan your editing approach and ensures you don't miss important issues during post-production.
