## Objective

To help podcasters develop an efficient, repeatable file management system that ensures easy access, smooth collaboration, and long-term storage of podcast assets.

## Why This Matters

Poor file organization can lead to:

- Lost audio or project files
- Confusion during editing
- Delayed publishing
- Inconsistent quality

Efficient file management saves **time, stress, and effort**, especially as your podcast grows.

## I. Create a Consistent Folder Structure

A reliable structure ensures every episode has its own space and files are easy to locate.

### Example Folder Structure

\`\`\`
Podcast Project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Episode_001/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Raw_Audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Edited_Audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Final/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Notes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artwork/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Transcripts/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Episode_002/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Music/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Intros_Outros/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Templates/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Branding/
\`\`\`

üîÅ Use this same structure for every episode for consistency.

## II. File Naming Conventions

Consistent naming avoids confusion. Include:

- Podcast name
- Episode number
- Guest name (if applicable)
- File type

### Examples:

- \`Plot49_Ep001_Intro.wav\`
- \`Plot49_Ep003_Interview_JaneDoe.wav\`
- \`Plot49_Ep005_FinalMix.mp3\`
- \`Plot49_Ep007_Transcript.docx\`

üö® Avoid spaces and vague names like \`final.wav\` or \`audio1.mp3\`.

## III. Use Cloud Storage + Backups

### Recommended Services

- **Google Drive**
- **Dropbox**
- **OneDrive**
- **iCloud**
- **Notion (for notes and tracking)**

### Best Practices

- Backup files in **two locations**: local and cloud
- Use version control for edits (e.g. \`v1\`, \`v2\`, \`final\`, \`final_v2\`)
- Set permissions if collaborating (e.g. view only vs. edit access)

## IV. Use Project Management Tools

Stay on top of tasks and deadlines with tools like:

- **Trello / Notion / ClickUp** ‚Äì episode planning, deadlines, checklists
- **Google Sheets** ‚Äì episode log with guests, dates, file links
- **Airtable** ‚Äì database for managing archives and marketing assets

### Sample Episode Tracking Sheet:

| Episode | Title | Guest | Status | Recording Date | Publish Date | File Links |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| 001 | Intro | N/A | Published | Jan 3 | Jan 10 | [Link] |
| 002 | Art & AI | Jane Doe | Editing | Jan 5 | Jan 17 | [Link] |
