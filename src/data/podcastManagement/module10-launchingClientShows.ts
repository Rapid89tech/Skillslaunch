# Working with Clients and Contracts

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the importance of professional client relationships
- Master the client onboarding process
- Create comprehensive podcast service contracts
- Manage client expectations effectively

## 💼 Why Client Relationships Matter

Working with clients (whether individuals, businesses, or agencies) is more than delivering a service—it's about:

- **Building trust and long-term collaboration**
- **Establishing clear expectations**
- **Creating professional boundaries**
- **Ensuring payment and workflow clarity**

**"Great podcast management isn't just about editing audio—it's about managing people, timelines, and expectations."**

## 📋 Initial Client Onboarding Process

A smooth onboarding sets the tone for the entire relationship.

### 🔹 Discovery Call
- Understand the client's goals, audience, and content style
- Clarify what services are needed: editing, publishing, strategy, guest booking, etc.
- Determine their budget, timeline, and communication preferences

### 🔹 Proposal or Scope of Work (SOW)
- Custom package or tiered options (e.g., per episode, monthly retainer)
- Outline deliverables, timeline, and pricing
- Include any add-ons (e.g., audiograms, guest coordination)

### 🔹 Client Intake Form
- Get access to their branding assets, podcast host, past episodes, etc.
- Ask for a style guide (tone, music, formatting preferences)
- Collect login info securely if needed (use LastPass or encrypted forms)

## 🧾 Key Components of a Podcast Contract

A contract protects both the freelancer/agency and the client. It defines the legal and professional framework for the partnership.

### 🔹 Essential Clauses to Include:

#### **Scope of Work**
- Specific services offered (editing, publishing, guest outreach, strategy, etc.)
- Number of revisions per episode
- What's not included

#### **Payment Terms**
- Project-based or retainer
- Due dates and late fee policy
- Preferred payment method

#### **Timeline & Turnaround**
- Example: "Episodes delivered within 3 business days"
- Note delays due to late client submission or holidays

#### **Ownership & Licensing**
- Who owns the final audio and assets
- Can you use clips for your portfolio?

#### **Client Responsibilities**
- Timely submission of files
- Feedback deadlines
- Providing clear direction and materials

#### **Termination Clause**
- How either party can cancel (notice period, refund policy)

#### **Confidentiality & NDA (if needed)**
- Especially important with private client data or unreleased episodes

#### **Revisions & Disputes**
- How many edits are included?
- What happens if the client is unhappy?

## 📈 Managing Client Expectations

### 🔹 Communication is Key
- Use a shared project management tool (e.g., Asana, Notion, Trello)
- Send weekly check-ins or episode status updates
- Set boundaries: office hours, turnaround times, communication platforms (Slack, email, etc.)

### 🔹 Under-Promise, Over-Deliver
- Build in buffer time for delivery
- Surprise clients with bonus assets or quick responses when possible

### 🔹 Regular Reporting
- Monthly recap: number of episodes published, highlights, performance
- Align content decisions with analytics and goals

## 🛠 Tools to Work Effectively with Clients

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Notion / Trello / Asana** | Episode tracking and task management |
| **Google Docs** | Script sharing and show notes collaboration |
| **Calendly / TidyCal** | Booking meetings or recordings |
| **Loom** | Explainer videos for deliverables or processes |
| **Dubsado / HoneyBook** | Client CRM, contracts, invoicing |
| **HelloSign / DocuSign** | Legally binding contract signatures |

## 🔁 Client Lifecycle (From Lead to Long-Term)

1. **Lead Generation** → Discovery call or DM inquiry
2. **Proposal & Contract** → Signed and deposited
3. **Kickoff & Onboarding** → Intake forms, access, timeline setup
4. **Ongoing Delivery** → Weekly/monthly service, reporting
5. **Feedback Loop** → Regular calls or check-ins
6. **Renewal or Upsell** → End of contract review
7. **Offboarding** → Final files, testimonial request, closeout

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Working without a signed contract
- Being unclear on revision limits
- Allowing scope creep without adjusting pricing
- Not discussing copyright or usage rights
- Poor file or deadline management

## 📌 Final Thought

**"Clear contracts create creative freedom. When expectations are defined, you can focus on great work—not miscommunication."**

### 📚 Suggested Activity
Students draft a basic client contract or outline key elements they would include in a podcast service agreement. Pair it with a mock client onboarding plan using a Trello board or Notion template.

# Pricing Podcast Management Services

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand factors that affect podcast service pricing
- Learn different pricing models and when to use them
- Calculate fair and profitable rates
- Develop pricing strategies for growth

## 💡 Why Pricing Strategy Matters

Pricing strategy:
- Sets client expectations
- Reflects the value and expertise you bring
- Ensures your business is sustainable
- Avoids burnout and underpayment

**"Pricing isn't just about what it costs — it's about what it's worth."**

## 🎯 Factors That Affect Pricing

Before setting rates, consider these variables:

### 🔹 Your Experience & Skills
- **Beginner** → may charge lower, but still fair
- **Experienced** → can justify higher rates with past results

### 🔹 Scope of Services
- One-off editing vs. full-service management
- More services = higher rate

### 🔹 Turnaround Time
- Rush edits or short deadlines may warrant higher pricing

### 🔹 Episode Length & Frequency
- 15-minute biweekly podcast ≠ 1-hour weekly show
- Consider both time spent and value delivered

### 🔹 Client Type
- Solopreneurs may have smaller budgets
- Businesses or agencies expect to pay more and require more support

## 📦 Common Pricing Models

| Model | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Per Episode** | Flat rate per episode | Simple editing or launch-only work |
| **Monthly Retainer** | Fixed monthly fee for recurring services | Ongoing shows with multiple episodes |
| **Hourly Rate** | Charge for time spent | Custom or unpredictable projects |
| **Package / Tiered** | Bundle services at different levels | Clients with varied needs and budgets |
| **Project-Based** | One-time fee for launch or campaign | Podcast launches or mini-series |

## 💰 Sample Podcast Pricing Breakdown

### ✅ Basic Editing Package ($75–$150/episode)
- Clean audio
- Add intro/outro + music
- Normalize and export to MP3
- 2–3 day turnaround

### ✅ Full Production Package ($300–$600/episode)
- Editing
- Show notes writing
- Scheduling and uploading
- Audiogram or social graphic
- Email newsletter copy
- Performance tracking

### ✅ Monthly Retainer ($800–$3,000+/month)
- 4 episodes per month
- Full production + strategy calls
- Guest coordination
- Promotion assets
- Client reporting

### ✅ Launch Package ($1,000–$5,000/project)
- Strategy + branding
- Tech setup + hosting
- Trailer + first 3 episodes
- Distribution setup
- Launch plan + training

## 🧮 How to Calculate Your Rates

### Estimate Time Involved
- Editing = 1–3x episode length
- Writing, scheduling, coordination, graphics, etc.

### Set a Target Hourly Rate
- Example: $40/hour minimum
- Include admin, revisions, communication

### Account for Expenses
- Software, subscriptions (Descript, Adobe, Auphonic)
- VA support, marketing costs

### Factor in Profit Margin
- Don't just break even—build a business

**"If it takes you 5 hours to deliver an episode and you charge $100, you're earning $20/hour before expenses."**

## 📈 How to Raise Rates Over Time

- Increase rates annually or per contract renewal
- Add new services or deliverables
- Base pricing on value delivered, not just time spent
- Use testimonials and case studies to justify pricing
- Offer a transition option to retain long-term clients

## 🛠 Tools to Support Pricing & Invoicing

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Dubsado / HoneyBook** | Proposals, contracts, invoicing |
| **Wave / FreshBooks / QuickBooks** | Bookkeeping + recurring invoices |
| **Notion / Airtable** | Track time, packages, and delivery |
| **Calendly + Stripe** | Paid consults or onboarding calls |
| **PayPal / Wise / Stripe** | Payment processing |

## ⚠️ Common Pricing Mistakes

- Charging too low to "get clients"
- Including too much in "unlimited" edits
- Not having a contract outlining scope
- Ignoring your actual hours and expenses
- Not reviewing and adjusting prices annually

## 📌 Final Thought

**"Price your services not just to survive — but to thrive."**

Clear pricing + clear deliverables = better clients, better boundaries, and better business.

### 💡 Suggested Activity
Ask students to:
- Design 3 podcast management packages (basic, standard, premium)
- Write down what's included and the price
- Practice a pitch explaining the value of each

# Managing Multiple Shows Efficiently

## Learning Objectives:
- Build scalable systems for managing multiple podcasts
- Master organization and workflow efficiency
- Learn delegation and automation strategies
- Track performance across multiple shows

## 🎙️ Why Multi-Show Management Is a Challenge

When you manage more than one podcast, complexity increases:

- Multiple hosts, formats, and episode cadences
- Different target audiences and marketing channels
- More content = more moving parts (deadlines, scripts, assets)

**"Without a solid system, managing multiple shows can lead to missed deadlines, burnout, and quality drop-offs."**

## 🔧 Build a Scalable Infrastructure

### 🔹 Centralized Workspace
Use tools like Notion, Airtable, or ClickUp to:
- View all shows in one place
- Track episode status (Idea → Published)
- Link scripts, guests, assets by show

### 🔹 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Create SOPs per show to maintain consistency
- Example: "Podcast A" always releases Tuesdays with a newsletter; "Podcast B" uses audiograms only

### 🔹 Master Calendar View
- Visualize deadlines across all shows (color-coded)
- Tools: Google Calendar, Asana Timeline View, Trello Calendar Power-Up

## 📦 Template Everything

### 🔹 Episode Production Templates
- Scripts, show notes, audio folders, checklists
- Store in Notion, Google Docs, or a file drive

### 🔹 Weekly Workflow Templates

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| **Mon** | Final edits for Show A |
| **Tue** | Record Show B, prep social for Show A |
| **Wed** | Upload + schedule both |
| **Thu** | Guest outreach |
| **Fri** | Strategy & review |

### 🔹 Communication Templates
- Guest onboarding
- Weekly update emails to hosts or clients
- Publishing notifications

## 📁 Organize File Management

- Folder hierarchy by Show → Season → Episode
- Include consistent naming: ShowName_Ep#_Title_Date
- Store assets in shared drives (Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion)

**Tip:** Create duplicate templates that automatically generate this structure per new episode.

## 📊 Use Project Management Tools to Your Advantage

### ✅ Notion
- Dashboard per show
- Embedded episode database
- Linked databases for guests, assets, and social posts

### ✅ Trello
- Kanban board per show or a master board with color labels
- Use Butler automation for due date reminders

### ✅ Asana
- Templates per show with tasks & subtasks
- Assign tasks to VAs or editors
- Automate weekly workflows with rules (e.g., auto-move task after due date)

## 👥 Delegate & Collaborate Effectively

- Assign clear roles per show: who edits, who publishes, who handles guests
- Use Slack, ClickUp, or Notion comments for centralized communication
- Consider using VA teams or freelancers for specialized tasks (editing, graphics)

## 🔁 Automate Repetitive Tasks

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Zapier** | Move files → create tasks automatically |
| **Calendly + Zoom** | Auto-schedule guest interviews |
| **Buffer / Hootsuite** | Schedule recurring social posts |
| **Descript templates** | Speed up editing with presets |

## 🧠 Track Performance Across Shows

Create dashboards with:
- Downloads per episode
- Engagement (comments, shares)
- Top-performing guests or topics

Use these insights to adjust content strategy per show.

**Tip:** Combine Airtable + analytics tools (e.g., Chartmetric, Podchaser) for visual reports.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Time-block your calendar by show
- Batch similar tasks (edit all episodes on one day)
- Hold weekly review sessions
- Use recurring tasks + templates to stay consistent
- Archive completed episodes + assets for easy access

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using the same workflow for very different shows
❌ Failing to track overlapping deadlines
❌ No system for delegation or version control
❌ Relying on memory instead of tools
❌ Skipping documentation of assets or SOPs

## 📌 Final Thought

**"Managing multiple shows is a balancing act — systems, structure, and smart delegation are your safety net."**

With the right workflows and tools, managing multiple podcasts becomes repeatable, scalable, and even enjoyable.

- Create a sample dashboard for two podcasts using Trello or Notion
- Build an episode template for each show
- Identify 3 automation opportunities to streamline multi-show production
