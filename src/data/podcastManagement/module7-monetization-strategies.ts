### What is CPM?

CPM stands for "Cost Per Mille," meaning the cost per 1,000 downloads. It's a pricing model used to calculate revenue based on the number of times content (like a podcast episode) is downloaded.

### The Formula Explained:

- **Formula**: (Total Downloads √∑ 1,000) √ó CPM Rate
- **Total Downloads**: The number of times an episode is downloaded.
- **CPM Rate**: The amount charged per 1,000 downloads (in USD, as is standard in advertising).
- **Result**: The revenue generated per episode.

### Example Calculation:

- Suppose an episode gets **5,000 downloads**.
- The CPM rate is **$25** (R450, assuming an exchange rate of ~R18 per USD).
- Step 1: Divide downloads by 1,000 ‚Üí 5,000 √∑ 1,000 = **5**.
- Step 2: Multiply by CPM rate ‚Üí 5 √ó $25 = **$125**.
- In ZAR: $125 √ó R18 = **R2,250** per episode.

### What Does This Mean?

- **Revenue Generation**: If you're a podcaster, this shows how downloads translate to income.
- **On-Demand Access**: The revenue from CPM can fund free episodes, making content accessible to listeners without direct cost to them.
- **Context**: In South Africa, where data costs and access can be barriers, free episodes funded by CPM revenue ensure broader reach.

### Key Notes:

- **Exchange Rate Impact**: Since CPM rates are often in USD, your earnings in ZAR depend on the exchange rate.
- **Scalability**: More downloads = higher revenue. For example, 10,000 downloads at $25 CPM = $250 (R4,500).
- **Practical Use**: This model is common for podcasts or streaming platforms in South Africa, where ad revenue supports free content.
