## 🧠 Choosing the Right Tool

| Need | Best Tool |
|------|-----------|
| Visual, simple workflow | Trello |

## 🔁 Example Weekly Workflow (Any Tool)

- **Monday** – Plan & write script
- **Tuesday** – Record
- **Wednesday** – Edit
- **Thursday** – Final review & artwork
- **Friday** – Publish & promote

Use checklists, deadlines, and comments to stay on track.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Set recurring tasks for weekly episodes
- Use color-coded tags (e.g., "Editing," "Recorded," "Published")
- Keep assets (scripts, audio, show notes) linked to episode cards
- Review weekly to track progress and bottlenecks
- Archive completed episodes for records

## 📌 Final Thought

**"A podcast without a workflow is a recipe for burnout. Project management tools turn chaos into clarity."**
