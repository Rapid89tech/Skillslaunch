An MVP is a simplified version of your product that tests core assumptions with minimal resources. For example, a landing page for a mobile app can gauge interest through sign-ups. MVPs like explainer videos or prototypes (e.g., Figma) allow you to validate demand without heavy investment. By testing with your audience and tracking engagement (e.g., clicks, pre-orders), you confirm market fit and gather feedback for improvements. This lean approach saves time, reduces risk, attracts early adopters, and informs future development, ensuring a customer-driven product.

## What is an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest version of your product that still delivers value to customers and allows you to test your core business hypothesis. It's not about building a perfect product—it's about learning quickly and efficiently.

## Key MVP Principles

• **Minimum:** Include only essential features
• **Viable:** Must solve the core problem
• **Product:** Should be usable by real customers
• **Learning:** Designed to gather feedback and insights

## Types of MVPs

### 1. Landing Page MVP
A simple website that describes your product and collects email addresses or pre-orders. This tests interest without building the actual product.

### 2. Video MVP
An explainer video that demonstrates your product concept. This helps validate understanding and interest.

### 3. Prototype MVP
A basic version of your product (e.g., Figma mockups, paper prototypes) that users can interact with to provide feedback.

### 4. Wizard of Oz MVP
A manual process that simulates what your automated product would do. For example, manually processing orders that would eventually be automated.

### 5. Single Feature MVP
Focus on one core feature that solves the main problem, ignoring secondary features.

## MVP Development Process

1. **Identify Core Value:** What's the main problem you're solving?
2. **Define Success Metrics:** How will you measure if the MVP is working?
3. **Build Minimum Features:** Only include what's absolutely necessary
4. **Test with Real Users:** Get feedback from your target audience
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Make improvements based on what you learn

## MVP Success Indicators

• **User Engagement:** Are people using your MVP?
• **Feedback Quality:** Are you getting actionable insights?
• **Problem Validation:** Are you confirming the problem exists?
• **Solution Validation:** Is your solution addressing the problem?
• **Willingness to Pay:** Are users willing to pay for your solution?

## Common MVP Mistakes

• **Over-engineering:** Including too many features
• **Perfectionism:** Trying to make it perfect before testing
• **Ignoring Feedback:** Not listening to user input
• **Wrong Metrics:** Focusing on vanity metrics instead of learning
• **No Clear Hypothesis:** Not knowing what you're trying to prove

## MVP Tools

• **Landing Pages:** Unbounce, Leadpages, Webflow
• **Prototyping:** Figma, Sketch, InVision
• **Surveys:** Typeform, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms
• **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Hotjar, Mixpanel
• **Communication:** Email, Slack, Discord

Remember: The goal of an MVP is to learn, not to launch a perfect product. Focus on gathering insights that will help you build the right product for your customers.`
