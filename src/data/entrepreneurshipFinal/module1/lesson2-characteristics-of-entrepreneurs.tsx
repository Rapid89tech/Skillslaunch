Entrepreneurs share common traits that help them succeed, even through challenges.

## Key Entrepreneurial Traits

| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Vision** | Seeing opportunities and future possibilities | Study trends, plan long-term, think creatively |
| **Resilience** | Bouncing back from failure and setbacks | Learn from mistakes, stay focused on your goal |
| **Risk-Taking** | Willingness to try, even without guarantees | Start small, manage risks, make informed decisions |
| **Creativity** | Solving problems in new or better ways | Practice brainstorming, learn from different industries |
| **Passion** | Strong motivation and belief in your mission | Choose a business you care about |
| **Adaptability** | Being flexible when things change | Stay open-minded, use feedback to improve |
| **Persistence** | Not giving up when things get tough | Set small goals, stay committed, build routines |
