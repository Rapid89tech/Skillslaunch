Once you've identified a promising idea, conduct **basic market research** to understand your target audience.

## Why Market Research Is Essential:

• Helps you **tailor your product or service** to meet real needs

• Allows you to **focus marketing** on the right people

• Saves money by avoiding efforts that don't reach your ideal customer

• Increases customer satisfaction by solving specific problems

• Helps build a **unique value proposition** that speaks directly to your audience

Example: If you want to open a car repair business, it must be in an area where enough people own vehicles. Research prevents costly mistakes.

## Market Research Fundamentals

Market research is the foundation of any successful entrepreneurial venture, enabling you to identify your target customers, understand their needs, and validate your business idea. This process explores the critical steps of defining your audience, assessing demand, analyzing competitors, and gathering feedback to ensure your product or service aligns with market realities.

Through practical tools like surveys, focus groups, and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), you'll learn to make data-driven decisions that maximize your chances of success.

## Key Research Questions

• Who are my potential customers?
• What problems do they face?
• What solutions currently exist?
• How much are they willing to pay?
• Where do they look for solutions?

This systematic approach helps you build a business based on real market needs rather than assumptions.`
