# Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

How to Create an MVP for Your Startup  
An MVP is a simplified version of your product that tests core assumptions with minimal resources. For example, a landing page for a mobile app can gauge interest through sign-ups. MVPs like explainer videos or prototypes (e.g., Figma) allow you to validate demand without heavy investment. By testing with your audience and tracking engagement (e.g., clicks, pre-orders), you confirm market fit and gather feedback for improvements. This lean approach saves time, reduces risk, attracts early adopters, and informs future development, ensuring a customer-driven product.
