How to Create a Customer Persona | Step-by-Step Guide  
Creating customer personas involves building fictional profiles of your ideal customers based on demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral data. For example, a persona like "Sarah, a 32-year-old marketing manager" helps humanize your audience, guiding product design and marketing. Personas clarify who you're targeting, ensuring your offering aligns with their goals (e.g., healthy meals) and challenges (e.g., time constraints). This process enhances focus, preventing generic strategies that fail to resonate. By visualizing your audience, you can craft tailored messages, choose effective channels, and prioritize features, increasing customer engagement and loyalty while optimizing resource use.
