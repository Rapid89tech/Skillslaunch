A successful business begins with a **real problem** or **market need**—not just a product idea.

## Ask Yourself:

• Does my idea solve a problem or meet a clear need?

• Are people willing to pay for the solution?

• Is there enough demand to sustain and grow the business?

## Key Principles

A business opportunity exists when there's a gap between what people need and what's currently available in the market. The best business ideas come from:

• **Observing problems** in your daily life or community
• **Listening to complaints** about existing products or services
• **Identifying inefficiencies** in current processes
• **Spotting trends** that create new needs

Remember: A good business idea solves a real problem that people are willing to pay to have solved. It's not about what you want to sell—it's about what people actually need and want to buy.`
