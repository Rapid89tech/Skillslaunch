    textContent: `# What is Entrepreneurship?

Entrepreneurship is the process of **identifying unmet needs or problems in the market**, developing **creative solutions**, and organizing **resources** to launch and grow a **sustainable business**. Entrepreneurs take initiative to create value, solve problems, and build something meaningful—often from nothing.

They are drivers of economic growth, job creation, and innovation in communities.

## Key Components of Entrepreneurship

• **Opportunity Recognition:** Spotting problems, gaps, or needs in the market

• **Innovation:** Creating or improving products, services, or processes

• **Resource Management:** Organizing people, money, and tools effectively

• **Value Creation:** Providing something useful that people are willing to pay for

• **Risk-taking:** Making decisions in uncertain situations

Entrepreneurship is not just about starting a business—it's about identifying real problems in your community and creating solutions that people actually want and need. This process requires creativity, persistence, and a deep understanding of your market.`
