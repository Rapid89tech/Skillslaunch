# Operational Plan

How to Write an Operational Plan for Your Business  
The Operational Plan outlines how your business will function, covering structure, location, production, suppliers, equipment, logistics, and customer support. For BrightBox, it might describe a small Johannesburg warehouse, weekly kit assembly, and courier delivery. This section shows stakeholders your business is practical and scalable, detailing how you'll deliver value efficiently. A clear plan addresses resource needs, cost estimates, and quality control, ensuring operational feasibility. It reassures investors of your readiness, making your business plan actionable and credible.

### **Production or Service Delivery Process**

It covers tools, quality control, and timelines, ensuring consistent value delivery. This section shows stakeholders your business is efficient and customer-focused, addressing how you maintain standards. A clear process reduces risks, like delays, and demonstrates scalability.

### **Suppliers & Inventory**

The suppliers and inventory section outlines sourcing materials and managing stock, like BrightBox's monthly orders from EcoFarm for seeds. It details supplier relationships, payment terms, and inventory systems (e.g., Excel initially). This clarity ensures reliable supply chains, preventing shortages or delays. Backup plans, like secondary suppliers, show preparedness. This section reassures stakeholders of your operational efficiency, minimizing risks and costs. A well-managed supply chain enhances your plan's credibility, proving you can deliver consistently to meet customer demand.

### **Facilities & Equipment**
