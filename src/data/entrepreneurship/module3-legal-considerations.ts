#### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- **Shared risk and reward**
- **Democratic decision-making** (one member = one vote)
- **Often eligible for government support**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages:
- **Slower decision-making**
- **Profits must be shared among members**
- **Legal registration and ongoing governance required**

#### üë§ Best For:
Agricultural businesses, artisan groups, community-based projects

### 5. Non-Profit Organisation (NPO)
Created for social, educational, religious, or charitable purposes, not for profit.

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages:

### Why Register Your Business Name?

### How to Register Your Business Name

#### Step-by-Step Process (Example: South Africa)

### What is Intellectual Property?
Intellectual Property refers to creations of the mind that have commercial value and can be legally protected. It gives you exclusive rights to use, sell, or license your creations.

### Types of Intellectual Property

| Copyright | Original creative works (artistic/literary) | Books, music, software code | Automatically protected on creation; registration optional |
| Design Rights | The visual design of objects | Packaging, product shapes | Register design with IP office |
| Trade Secrets | Confidential business information | Recipes, formulas, customer lists | Keep confidential, use NDAs |

### Trademarks
- **Protects brand identity**: names, logos, symbols, slogans

### Patents

- **Important for technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and unique products**

### Copyright
- **Protects original works** like books, music, art, software, films
- **Automatically applies** as soon as the work is created and fixed in a tangible form
- **Registration is optional** but can be useful in legal disputes
- **Allows the owner to control** reproduction, distribution, and public performance

### Design Rights
- **Protect the appearance of a product or packaging**
- **Registration protects the design** from being copied by competitors
- **Important for fashion, furniture, consumer goods, packaging design**

### Trade Secrets
- **Protect confidential business information** that gives a competitive edge
- **Examples**: secret recipes (like Coca-Cola), manufacturing processes, client lists
- **Protection relies on keeping information secret** through contracts (NDAs), security measures, and employee agreements

### Why Protect IP?
- **Safeguards your brand and innovations**
- **Increases business value** and can generate revenue (licensing, franchising)
- **Prevents competitors from copying your work**
- **Builds customer trust and loyalty**

### How to Protect Your IP
1. **Conduct an IP audit** to identify what needs protection
2. **Register trademarks, patents, or designs** with your country's IP office
3. **Use confidentiality agreements and NDAs** to protect trade secrets
4. **Monitor and enforce your IP rights** against infringement
5. **Seek advice from IP attorneys or experts** when necessary`
