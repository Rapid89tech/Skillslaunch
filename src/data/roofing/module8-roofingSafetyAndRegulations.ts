# Weather Considerations for Working at Heights

## 1. Introduction

Weather conditions play a critical role in the safety and efficiency of roofing, electrical, and construction work‚Äîespecially when working at heights. Understanding and responding appropriately to weather conditions can prevent accidents, injuries, and damage to equipment or property.

## 2. Why Weather Matters in High-Access Work

- Weather affects surface traction, visibility, material performance, and worker comfort
- Many height-related accidents are directly linked to environmental conditions
- Weather readiness improves planning, productivity, and safety compliance

## 3. Key Weather Factors and Their Impact

### A. Rain and Wet Conditions
- Slippery surfaces increase fall risk
- Reduced visibility and impaired tool handling
- Water intrusion may damage materials (e.g., roofing insulation, wood decking)
- Electrical hazard: moisture increases conductivity‚Äînever handle live wires in wet conditions

**Precautions:**
- Postpone non-essential roof work during rain
- Use slip-resistant footwear
- Cover exposed materials and openings with waterproof tarps

### B. Wind
- Strong gusts can cause loss of balance, tool drops, or material displacement
- Lightweight materials like tarps or insulation may become airborne
- Suspended scaffolds and aerial lifts are especially hazardous

**Precautions:**
- Cease work when wind speeds exceed 24 mph (38 km/h), or lower for lighter tasks
- Secure all materials and tools
- Avoid standing near roof edges or using large surface tools in gusty conditions

### C. Heat and Sun Exposure
- High temperatures increase risk of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and sunburn
- Roofing surfaces (especially metal or black membrane) can reach extreme temperatures
- Asphalt shingles become more pliable and may be damaged under foot traffic

**Precautions:**
- Schedule strenuous tasks during early morning or late afternoon
- Use sun protection: hats, sunscreen, long sleeves
- Hydrate frequently‚Äîat least one cup every 15‚Äì20 minutes in hot weather

### D. Cold and Snow/Ice
- Icy roofs and ladders are extremely hazardous due to slipping
- Cold affects tool performance (e.g., air hoses, batteries)
- Frozen water in roof systems may cause cracking or separation of materials

**Precautions:**
- Remove ice/snow before work begins using approved methods
- Use insulated gloves and non-slip boots
- Take frequent warm-up breaks in sheltered areas

### E. Lightning and Storms

- Sudden storms can create panic and lead to unsafe evacuations

**Precautions:**
- Immediately stop work if lightning is within 10 miles
- Use weather alerts and radar apps to monitor conditions
- Avoid tall structures and metal scaffolding during storms

## 4. Weather-Responsive Planning

### A. Pre-Work Assessment
- Check daily and hourly weather forecasts (temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation)
- Assess how weather will impact both safety and work quality
- Prepare contingency plans and reschedule if necessary

### B. Weather Delay Protocols
- Establish clear procedures for pausing or delaying work
- Secure all loose materials and tools before leaving the site
- Notify team members and update project timelines accordingly

## 5. Equipment and Material Considerations

|---------|------------------|
| Rain | Causes rusting, electrical hazards, slipping |
| Wind | Blows ladders, tarps, loose debris |
| Heat | Overheats machinery, weakens adhesives |
| Cold | Brittle shingles, freezing of sealants |
| UV Rays | Breaks down plastics, degrades coatings |

## 6. Personal Protective Measures

Use weather-appropriate PPE:
- Rain gear with slip-resistant boots
- Insulated gloves and jackets in cold
- Cooling vests and sun hats in heat
- Rotate work crews during harsh weather
- Monitor workers for signs of heatstroke, hypothermia, or fatigue

## 7. Legal and Safety Compliance

- OSHA does not set specific weather stoppage rules, but employers are required to protect workers from recognized hazards, including those caused by weather
- Safety officers should use weather-related Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs) before each shift
- Document delays and safety decisions for liability and compliance purposes

## 8. Conclusion

Weather is an uncontrollable but predictable factor in working at heights. Effective management includes anticipating risks, adjusting workflows, using appropriate PPE, and halting work when safety is compromised. Prioritizing weather considerations enhances safety, protects materials, and supports project success.
