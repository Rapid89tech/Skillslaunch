# Preparing the Roof Deck

## 1. Introduction

Preparing the roof deck is a critical phase in roofing installation or replacement. The roof deck serves as the structural foundation for all other roofing layers including underlayment, insulation, and roof covering. Proper preparation ensures durability, weather resistance, and safety.

## 2. What Is a Roof Deck?

The roof deck (also called decking or sheathing) is the flat surface attached to the roof framing (rafters or trusses).

It provides the base to which roofing materials are attached.

**Common Materials:**
- Plywood (typically 1/2" or 5/8" thick)
- Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
- Tongue-and-groove planks (in older or custom homes)
- Metal decking (in commercial structures)

## 3. Objectives of Deck Preparation

- Ensure the surface is structurally sound and level
- Identify and repair damaged or rotted areas
- Provide a clean, dry surface for proper adhesion and installation
- Comply with local codes and manufacturer specifications

## 4. Inspection of Existing Decking

Before installing any new roofing material, inspect the roof deck for:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rotted or soft wood | Caused by moisture intrusion |
| Warping or buckling | May result in uneven shingle placement |
| Loose or missing fasteners | Can cause movement or rattling |
| Delaminated sheathing | Especially in OSB, due to water exposure |
| Mold or mildew | Indicates moisture problems |

**Action:** Remove and replace damaged sections. Do not install new materials over compromised decking.

## 5. Preparation Steps

### Step 1: Clear the Deck
- Remove old roofing materials, nails, staples, and debris
- Sweep and inspect the surface for moisture or mold

### Step 2: Secure Fasteners
- Re-nail or screw down loose decking panels
- Use proper spacing and fastener type (e.g., ring-shank nails or screws)

### Step 3: Replace Damaged Panels
- Cut out and replace any rotted or weakened decking
- Use matching material thickness and type to maintain consistency

### Step 4: Level the Surface
- Check for humps or low spots
- Plane or shim as needed to create a flat, continuous surface

### Step 5: Moisture Barrier (Optional)
- In some areas, install a vapor barrier or sealant if required before underlayment

## 6. Tools and Equipment Used

- Pry bar or roofing shovel (for removal)
- Circular saw or reciprocating saw (for deck replacement)
- Measuring tape and chalk line
- Hammer or nail gun
- Screw gun or drill
- Safety gear (gloves, goggles, fall protection)

## 7. Safety Precautions

- Use fall protection systems when working at height
- Inspect for hidden rot that may cause footing hazards
- Keep work area free of debris and protruding nails

## 8. Building Code Requirements

- Roof deck material and installation must comply with local building codes
- Fastener spacing, material thickness, and span ratings are typically regulated
- Some codes require minimum slope or water-resistant underlayments based on climate

## 9. Quality Control Checklist

✅ All rotted or damaged decking removed
✅ Surface flat, clean, and dry
✅ Deck properly fastened to rafters or trusses
✅ No loose or squeaky panels
✅ Materials meet code specifications

# Laying Underlayment and Starter Shingles

## 1. Introduction

After the roof deck is prepared, the next crucial steps in roofing installation are applying the underlayment and starter shingles. These components serve as the foundation for the final roof covering, offering additional protection against water infiltration and wind damage.

## 2. Underlayment: Definition and Function

### What is Underlayment?
A protective layer installed between the roof deck and the final roofing material (e.g., shingles or tiles).

### Functions:
- Acts as a secondary water barrier in case shingles fail
- Protects the roof deck from wind-driven rain and snow
- Shields the deck from UV exposure during construction
- Adds a layer of fire resistance and helps with wind uplift

## 3. Types of Roofing Underlayment

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Asphalt-Saturated Felt | Traditional underlayment; comes in 15 lb or 30 lb weights. Economical but heavier. |
| Synthetic Underlayment | Lightweight, tear-resistant polypropylene or polyester; more durable and water-resistant. |
| Self-Adhering Membrane (Ice & Water Shield) | Rubberized asphalt layer that sticks to the roof deck; ideal for valleys, eaves, and low-slope roofs. |

## 4. Installing Underlayment: Step-by-Step

### Preparation:
- Ensure the roof deck is clean, dry, and smooth
- Verify slope and manufacturer guidelines for overlap

### Installation Process:
1. Start at the eaves and roll underlayment horizontally across the roof
2. Overlap rows by at least 2"–4", depending on material and slope
3. Fasten with roofing nails or staples (except for self-adhering membranes)
4. Lap ends of rolls by 6" or more
5. Extend underlayment over hips and ridges
6. Install ice & water shield in valleys, around chimneys, and at eaves (in cold climates)

**Note:** Self-adhering membranes require peel-and-stick installation without nails.

## 5. Starter Shingles: Definition and Purpose

### What Are Starter Shingles?
Pre-cut strips or specially designed shingles placed along the eaves and rakes before the first row of full shingles.

### Functions:
- Provide water-shedding protection beneath shingle joints
- Offer adhesive bond at roof edges for wind resistance
- Create a straight edge to align the first course of shingles

## 6. Types of Starter Shingles

- Pre-manufactured starter strips (matched to shingle brand)
- Cut-down 3-tab shingles (used in traditional methods)

**Note:** Starter shingles must have adhesive sealant along the edge closest to the eaves.

## 7. Installing Starter Shingles: Step-by-Step

### At the Eaves:
1. Lay the starter shingle with adhesive facing the eave edge
2. Overhang the eave and rake edge by 1/4" to 3/8"
3. Align the starter course flush with rake edge (or overlap slightly depending on design)
4. Nail starter shingle according to manufacturer instructions (typically 4–6 inches from the bottom edge)
5. Butt ends of starter shingles tightly together without gaps

### At the Rakes:
- Install starter shingles along the rake edge to seal against wind uplift
- Use full-length pieces for uniform appearance and sealing

## 8. Best Practices

- Always install underlayment before starter shingles
- Starter shingles must align perfectly to prevent gaps in the first row
- Avoid reusing old underlayment or starter pieces
- Use compatible materials and follow shingle manufacturer guidelines

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem it Causes |
|---------|-------------------|
| Skipping underlayment | Increases risk of leaks and deck rot |
| Misaligning starter shingles | Leads to crooked shingle rows |
| Not overlapping underlayment properly | Water seepage between layers |
| Using full shingles as starters without cutting off tabs | Water can penetrate at seams |

## 10. Summary Table

| Component | Function | Installation Tip |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Underlayment | Secondary water barrier | Overlap seams and secure firmly |
| Starter Shingles | Wind and water protection at edges | Align carefully and use adhesive strip |

# Flashing and Sealing Techniques

## 1. Introduction

Flashing and sealing are essential components of any roof system. They prevent water intrusion at joints, edges, and penetrations—areas where shingles, tiles, or panels alone cannot provide a watertight seal.

## 2. What is Flashing?

**Definition:** Flashing is a thin, waterproof material (usually metal or flexible membrane) installed at roof joints and penetrations to divert water away from critical areas.

### Common Flashing Materials:

| Material | Pros | Common Use Areas |
|----------|------|------------------|
| Galvanized Steel | Durable, affordable | Valleys, step flashing |
| Aluminum | Lightweight, corrosion-resistant | Chimneys, skylights, vent pipes |
| Copper | Long-lasting, flexible | High-end or decorative roofs |
| Lead | Highly flexible, self-sealing | Chimneys, older construction |
| Bituminous Membrane | Self-adhesive, easy to apply | Valleys, eaves, dormers |

## 3. Types of Flashing and Their Installation

| Type of Flashing | Location/Use | Installation Notes |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Step Flashing | Where roof meets a vertical wall (e.g., chimney, dormer) | Installed in layers between each row of shingles |
| Continuous (Apron) Flashing | Along the base of vertical walls or chimneys | Single long piece; requires expansion joints |
| Valley Flashing | In valleys where two roof planes meet | Must be wide enough for high water flow |
| Drip Edge Flashing | Along eaves and rakes | Directs water into gutters, prevents rot |
| Counter Flashing | Over step or base flashing (e.g., masonry walls) | Embedded into wall for extra protection |
| Vent Pipe Flashing | Around plumbing stacks or roof vents | Often pre-formed or rubber booted |

## 4. What is Sealing?

**Definition:** Sealing involves the application of sealants, caulking, or waterproof membranes to close small gaps and ensure a tight, water-resistant connection.

### Common Sealants Used:

| Sealant Type | Features | Best Uses |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Polyurethane | Flexible, UV-resistant, paintable | Flashing joints, skylights |
| Silicone | Waterproof, long-lasting, non-paintable | Metal-to-metal, glass |
| Butyl Rubber | Sticky, good for metal panels, durable | Sealing seams in metal roofs |
| Roof Cement | Bitumen-based, adhesive/sealant combo | Emergency repairs, flashing |

## 5. Critical Flashing & Sealing Locations

- **Valleys** – prone to high water flow
- **Chimneys** – require both step and counter flashing
- **Vents & Pipes** – pre-molded flashings are sealed with caulk
- **Skylights** – require apron flashing and sealant around perimeter
- **Eaves & Rakes** – need drip edge flashing and sealant under overlaps
- **Roof-to-Wall Intersections** – step flashing with counter flashing and proper sealant

## 6. Installation Guidelines and Best Practices

### Flashing:
- Always install flashing before final roof covering in affected areas
- Ensure overlap and shingle-style layering to direct water downward
- Use nail placement carefully (do not puncture exposed flashing)
- Follow manufacturer instructions for metal roofing flashings

### Sealing:
- Apply sealant on clean, dry surfaces
- Use compatible sealants with roofing material
- Apply with proper bead thickness—not too little, not excessive
- Avoid relying on sealant as a primary waterproofing method; it's a secondary defense

## 7. Common Flashing Errors and Consequences

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Skipping flashing | Water leaks and structural damage |
| Incorrect overlap direction | Water intrusion under flashing |
| Using wrong sealant | Premature failure, cracking |
| Over-sealing moving joints | Cracking due to expansion/shrinkage |
| Failing to embed counter flashing | Water entry into walls |

## 8. Roof Flashing for Different Roofing Types

| Roofing Type | Flashing Needs |
|--------------|----------------|
| Asphalt Shingles | Step flashing, vent flashing, drip edge |
| Tile Roof | Requires mortar or tile-compatible flashing |
| Metal Roof | Special foam closures, panel-specific flashing kits |

## 9. Inspection Tips

- Check all flashing during annual roof inspections
- Look for loose or corroded flashing
- Identify cracked or hardened sealant
- Verify proper overlap and placement at transitions
- Ensure sealant is not peeling, missing, or stretched

## 10. Summary Table

| Task | Flashing or Sealing? | Material Example |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Direct water at valleys | Flashing | Galvanized steel |
| Seal around pipe vents | Both | Rubber boot + silicone |
| Stop leaks at skylights | Both | Step flashing + sealant |
| Protect eaves from rot | Flashing | Drip edge flashing |
| Fix small nail hole | Sealing | Roof cement |

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is step flashing preferred over continuous flashing on sloped intersections?
2. What problems can occur if flashing is not installed under siding?
3. How does counter flashing enhance step flashing?
4. What are the signs of a failed roof sealant?
5. How do flashing requirements change for a metal roof?

# Vent and Ridge Cap Installation

## 1. Introduction

Roof ventilation plays a crucial role in maintaining the temperature, humidity, and lifespan of a roofing system. Ridge caps and venting systems are essential to allow proper airflow and to prevent moisture buildup in the attic space.

## 2. Purpose of Roof Ventilation

### Why Ventilate?
- Reduces heat buildup in attics
- Prevents moisture accumulation, mold, and rot
- Extends roofing material lifespan
- Improves energy efficiency
- Prevents ice dam formation in colder climates

## 3. Types of Roof Vents

| Vent Type | Location | Features / Usage |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Ridge Vent | Roof ridge | Continuous airflow along the peak |
| Soffit Vent | Roof eaves | Intake air from lower part of roof |
| Gable Vent | Gable ends | Passive ventilation at roof ends |
| Turbine Vent | Near ridge | Wind-powered exhaust |
| Power Vent | Mid/upper roof | Electric or solar-powered fan system |
| Box Vent (Static) | Upper roof plane | No moving parts, allows hot air to escape |

## 4. Ridge Vent Installation

### Materials Needed:
- Ridge vent (plastic or metal)
- Roofing nails
- Ridge cap shingles
- Roofing adhesive (optional)
- Circular saw (for cutting ridge slot)

### Installation Steps:

#### Mark and Cut Ridge Slot:
- Cut a slot (typically 1" on each side of the ridge board) along the ridge
- Leave 6" uncut at both ends for structural integrity

#### Install Ridge Vent Material:
- Place ridge vent over the slot and align it properly
- Secure with roofing nails through pre-marked holes

#### Seal Ends and Joints:
- Use end caps or mesh to block debris and pests
- Seal any butt joints with manufacturer-recommended methods

#### Cover with Ridge Cap Shingles:
- Install shingles over the vent, overlapping them neatly
- Nail securely, using roofing nails at appropriate spacing

## 5. Ridge Cap Shingle Installation

### Purpose:
Ridge caps protect the ridge vent and provide a finished appearance while allowing ventilation.

### Installation Guidelines:
- Use pre-cut ridge cap shingles or cut 3-tab shingles into thirds
- Start at one end and overlap each shingle (typically 5" exposure)
- Drive nails about 6" apart and seal the last cap with adhesive
- Ensure shingles are centered over the ridge and nailed into each side of the roof

## 6. Combining Ridge and Soffit Venting

For optimal attic ventilation:
- Cool air enters through soffit vents (intake)
- Hot air exits through ridge vents (exhaust)
- This creates a continuous airflow path from eave to ridge

### Ventilation Rule of Thumb (Balanced System):
For every 300 square feet of attic space, provide 1 square foot of net free ventilation area (NFA)—split equally between intake and exhaust.

## 7. Common Installation Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem Caused |
|---------|----------------|
| No soffit vents with ridge vent | Poor airflow, ineffective ventilation |
| Blocking vents with insulation | Prevents air circulation |
| Overlapping ridge shingles incorrectly | Water infiltration, wind damage |
| Cutting ridge slot too wide/narrow | Reduced venting or structural compromise |
| Inadequate nailing or sealing | Ridge cap blow-off, leakage |

## 8. Safety Precautions

- Use roof safety harnesses and toe boards
- Avoid working in wet or windy weather
- Keep cutting tools secured when on the roof
- Be cautious of electrical lines near roof edges

## 9. Inspection and Maintenance Tips

- Check ridge vents for cracks, clogs, or animal nesting
- Ensure ridge caps are secure and not curling or missing
- Clean debris from soffit vents regularly
- Replace worn or cracked vent sections to maintain effectiveness

## 10. Summary Table

| Component | Function | Key Installation Tip |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Ridge Slot | Allows hot air escape | Leave 6" uncut ends for strength |
| Ridge Vent | Exhaust vent across the ridge | Align, nail properly, cover ends |
| Ridge Cap Shingles | Protect vent and provide finish | Nail with correct exposure, overlap |
| Soffit Vent | Air intake from roof edge | Keep free of insulation/debris |

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is it important to balance intake and exhaust ventilation?
2. What could happen if ridge caps are not properly nailed?
3. How would you inspect a ridge vent system from inside the attic?
4. Can ridge vents be used with gable vents? Why or why not?
